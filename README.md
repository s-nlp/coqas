**Snippets:**

"I did feel a bit more relaxed after drinking it too...I wonder if it was legitimate or just the product marketing? The taste is smooth and mellow with a slight hint of chocolate. It's heartier than regular tea and lighter (and better for your health) than coffee. Let the patient's taste decide. In general, the dry and dirty tongue always prefers tea to coffee, and will quite decline milk, unless with tea. Coffee is a better restorative than tea, but a greater impairer of the digestion."

The answer to this question depends on the type of tea. If you are looking for a cup that has some caffeine and flavor, then go with green teas. Green teas have caffeine, but they also contain antioxidants which help prevent cancer cells. They can be used as an alternative to coffee because it does not produce any stomach upset like coffee. However, if you want something more relaxing than coffee, try black tea, especially when drinking in the evening. Black tea contains natural flavors, such as cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, cloves, etc.
