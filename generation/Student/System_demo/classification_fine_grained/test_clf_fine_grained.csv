ios,android,safer,PREDICATE-FULL,why ios is safer than android .
ios,android,safer,PREDICATE-FULL,one reason that ios is safer than android is that bug fixes to the operating system are rolled out faster.
ios,android,safer,PREDICATE-FULL,ios apps are generally safer than android apps.
ios,android,safer,PREDICATE-FULL,why ios is safer than android the relative vulnerability of android vs. ios comes down to the level of control the vendors have over products and the marketplace for development and distribution of apps.
ios,android,simpler,PREDICATE-FULL,"for me personally, ios is still easier and faster (and simpler) to use for everyday living, which is probably why my iphone 5 gets more use than my note 2 but obviously, the customization and freedom is better on android."

javascript,python,language,BAD,one thing about javascript being faster than python: one needs to distinguish between a language and its implementation.
javascript,python,language,BAD,"in practice, javascript tends to be a lot faster than python, not because of any feature of the languages themselves-they're broadly comparable in terms of expressiveness and capabilities-but because companies like microsoft, google, and mozilla have invested heavily in making javascript faster."

javascript,python,guys,BAD,"q: there are some guys that i work with, and one of their comments on javascript lately, since i've been wanting to use rhino because i love javascript... what they brought up is that javascript is becoming a lot like python, and that may or may not be such a great thing."

python,javascript,simpler,PREDICATE-FULL,"in general, debugging javascript code is not as easy as debugging your python code although firebug has made the problem much simpler already."
python,javascript,simpler,PREDICATE-FULL,"so we hit on a simpler hack: we wrote a javascript function to do the fetching and then ""hijacked"" the raw_input builtin by replacing the interpreter's reference to it (we picked raw_input because the emscripten python interpreter didn't implement it anyway)."
python,javascript,ways,BAD,because i found python to be alot more simpler to learn than javascript in many ways.

samsung,toshiba,cheaper,PREDICATE-FULL,the build quality of the samsung does not rival the cheaper of the two toshiba units.
samsung,toshiba,cheaper,PREDICATE-FULL,although toshiba is a market leader in japan but as far as the hold in uk market is concerned then there is an edge for samsung as the price of samsung samsung lcd tv's are much more cheaper than toshiba with several other added features.

toshiba,samsung,bigger,BAD,"samsung was also bigger than the accumulated totals of toshiba, no. 4 micron technology and fifth-ranked elpida memory."

toshiba,samsung,higher,PREDICATE-DEPENDENT,"toshiba and seagate share the second spot, and samsung falls behind because of its higher power consumption at peak streaming reads."
toshiba,samsung,higher,PREDICATE-DEPENDENT,"however, it could not match up to the stellar performance of the samsung galaxy tab 7.7 simply because the samsung slate has a higher capacity 5100mah battery, which actually weighed less than the toshiba slate."
