java,scala,larger,BAD,"and we find that you know, there are little libraries that we can write, even big libraries we can write like we have a like an analytics engine that's written in scala; and you know, we plug this in to a larger java application and then we find that at the edges of this library, people start writing scala to interface with it and then it sort of grows out like a zombie virus."

ibm,dell,pricing,BAD,"similarly, ibm is about 40% higher than the dell or hp equivalent on their blades (your street pricing may vary) because of the perception of ibm as the blade standard and the speed to which the blue adherents signed up for more ibm tin."
ibm,dell,pricing,BAD,"since intel has introduced flat pricing (which it should have done from the go) to help it's lawsuit case, dell feels a bit left, compared to ibm, hp, etc. ."

apple,amazon,easier,PREDICATE-DEPENDENT,the problem with your argument is that apple dominates the tablet market and apple is darn well going to make it far easier to buy the latest song or e-book from itunes than through amazon.
apple,amazon,easier,PREDICATE-DEPENDENT,apple too realised that it would be easier to have the labels onside for a new streaming service rather than trying to circumvent them like google and amazon have done.
apple,amazon,easier,PREDICATE-DEPENDENT,this is a function i use regularly on my laptop computer and i suspect apple's in-app store advantage is short-lived: it's easier for amazon to implement an in-app bookstore than it is for apple to develop a full-featured online bookstore.

microsoft,sony,quicker,BAD,it looks like microsoft is reacting quicker to its missteps than sony did in the last generation.
microsoft,sony,quicker,BAD,they say that microsoft is better because  this would never happen to them  but really this just proves that sony is better because they actually came out of this situation quicker than i expected.
microsoft,sony,quicker,BAD,could mean microsoft is keeping the units coming quicker than sony or the units are sitting on the shelves longer.
microsoft,sony,quicker,BAD,i'm kind of surprised microsoft had a quicker turnover than sony about this considering both companies' recent history of indie treatment.
microsoft,sony,quicker,BAD,i would expect microsoft to abandon the 360 significantly quicker than sony will the ps3 though - they abandoned xbox pretty sharpish so i can't see them changing tack too dramatically here.

ds,ps2,faster,PREDICATE-FULL,"with psps selling for roughly twice the price of ds, it is certainly not all doom and gloom for sony's handheld, particularly given sony has shipped 17 million psps in significantly faster time than psone or ps2."
ds,ps2,faster,PREDICATE-FULL,"probably bigger than the visual difference between ps2 and xbox games.as i said before,psp's games will cost less and be easier to develop for.so if i'm right then this means psp will have more games coming out faster than ds."
ds,ps2,larger,BAD,"i don't know, but the nintendo ds has (so far) sold faster than the ps2 did simply because their potential market was much larger."
ds,ps2,larger,BAD,"by october of november, the ds should have a larger installed base than the ps2."

ds,ps2,larger,BAD,"fifty-two weeks into the marketplace, the installed base in the u.s. for the ds is larger than the installed base for the ps2 at the same time."
ds,ps2,larger,BAD,"like you said: the ds pretty much has something for everyone at this point, as did the ps2 before it, and the larger install bases are attractive to publishers/developers because they'll typically angle more projects toward those platforms."
ds,ps2,market,BAD,"i don't know, but the nintendo ds has (so far) sold faster than the ps2 did simply because their potential market was much larger."

ps2,ds,gamers,BAD,probably because a) the ds is fairly unpopular among adult gamers in the west and b) the ds port of disgaea was significantly inferior to the ps2 and psp version.
ps2,ds,gamers,BAD,ps2 was the most popular console of its time and was in almost as many households back then as the nintendo ds is in gamers' hands now.
ps2,ds,gamers,BAD,you need to bring it onto wii u also huge nintendo gamers who bought kingdom hearts series on ds that sold massive than actually ps2's kingdom hearts series.
ps2,ds,gamers,BAD,"with nintendo's competitive ds and upcoming wii, it seems like they're trying to redefine themselves entirely for gamers who, over the past few years, have been more apt to pick up a ps2 controller."
ps2,ds,gamers,BAD,"since europeans tend to be casual gamers, older versions of consoles sell well there - the ps2 grabbed a 47 per cent market share in europe in 2007, with the nintendo ds in second place with a 25 per cent market share."

ps2,ds,psp,BAD,you are so write i've been telling this to all the kids in my class but just cuz the radio said that ps2 is better than gamecube they think that psp is better than ds.
ps2,ds,psp,BAD,"with psps selling for roughly twice the price of ds, it is certainly not all doom and gloom for sony's handheld, particularly given sony has shipped 17 million psps in significantly faster time than psone or ps2."
ps2,ds,psp,BAD,"my guess would be that coming up with creative ideas for games on the ds would be a lot harder than putting a toned down ps2 game on a handheld, which is basically what their doing with the psp."

ps2,ds,version,BAD,"if it's a game i've already played and loved, i'll almost always get the latest remake for the improvements (weird exceptions like rayman ds, which is inferior to the ps2 version of rayman 2, may occur, but are rare)."
ps2,ds,version,BAD,"and though the ps2 sold the flat, simple graphics much better than the ds, the portable version of fsr still pops, even if the graphics devolve into impenetrable blocks of pixels at times."
ps2,ds,version,BAD,i enjoyed the ds version of legend more than playing on the ps2.
ps2,ds,version,BAD,"first make sure you have the ds version, i think the ps2 one has ."
ps2,ds,bigger,BAD,"probably bigger than the visual difference between ps2 and xbox games.as i said before,psp's games will cost less and be easier to develop for.so if i'm right then this means psp will have more games coming out faster than ds."
ps2,ds,bigger,BAD,these figures should appear at least a little bit surprising as wii and ds both have more top hit software than ps2 even though the ps2 hardware base was bigger than either platform in 2000-2009.
ps2,ds,bigger,BAD,"bigger screen, better controller, more comfortable, and even though it's sprite-based and has that nice upper-screen map, the ds version is not as pretty as the ps2 version."
ps2,ds,bigger,BAD,easy when you think about it-the ds has a bigger install base.you can also play ds games on 3ds.i remember that after the ps3 launched someone asked sony why didn't they put god of war 2 on that instead of ps2.they said the ps2 had a much bigger install base so it was better to try to sell the game to over 100 million than to the less than a million who had the ps3.that is exactly what nintendo are doing now with pokemon black/white 2.
ps2,ds,earlier for ps3 which were also on ps2,BAD,"yeah i'm aware, but i figured since someone mentioned shadow of the colussus and ico earlier for ps3 which were also on ps2... also it more or less suited wii better and led to a sequel for the ds."
