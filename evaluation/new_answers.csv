0,microsoft,sony,which next-gen console is the best NITENDO SONYS  PS3 - MICROSOFT XBOX 360?,How can you even ask this question yet?

You need to ask the question again when all three systems are out!,"[""How can you even ask this question yet?

You need to ask the question again when all three systems are out!"", ""The story I keep hearing is that Nintendo's Revolution will play all the old Nintendo games from most of their different consoles.  For me, that sells it more than anything.  Being able to play Super Mario 3, then go to Super Mario 64, then go to Need for Speed Underground all on the same box would be awesome."", ""They all have their strengths and weeknesses.  Its really more or less a view of personal choice.  More then likely people will have multiple next generation consoles when they can afford it (400 dollars for one, 400 dollars for another, with the Nitendo being the cheapest but mostly being considered too kidish based to many).  They all have backwards compatibility in a way, Xbox will have a emulator, Ps3 will just have backwards capatibility from the get go, and even Nitendo I believe.  What it comes down to though is the games, which is why people will own many console systems in the future.  The first Xbox may of been better with graphics, but it wasn't enough to lure everybody from the Ps2 simply because the Ps2 had some damn awesome games.  We'll see how the games fan out, 18 games for the Xbox 360 /NOW/ isn't enough to go crazy over.  Save your money until you can tell which is better by who has the best games that you absolutely must have."", ""I don't think anyone can really that answer yet since all we have seen is the XBOX 360.  It also depends on what you look for in a console and what type of games you like.  The XBOX 360 seems to be heavy on First Person shooters and racing games.  While the XBOX 360 is powerful and has a 3 core processor, Sony keeps hyping its own Cell processor and 512MB custom GPU from nVidia. As the XBOX 360 and PS3 are going head to head it will be hard to make a final decision on this until both consoles are seen side by side but there is still no good way to directly compare them. The Nintendo Revolution has less horsepower than both the PS3 and XBOX 360 but Nintendo is hoping to wow you with their unique controller and games.  The Revolution is not hyping HD content as is the PS3 and Nintendo says the Revolution will have approximately double the specs of the GameCube. While the XBOX 360 and PS3 are around $400 or more the Revolution will be $99 to $149 at launch.  I don't care what walk of life you come from, $149 (despite the lack of power) is an excellent price considering the premiums of the PS3 and XBOX 360. You will have the PS3 only camps and the XBOX 360 camps and the Revolution camps.  Some will want both the 360 and PS3, some will only want the Revolution and some will want all three. In the end it comes down to 'which console meets your demands'.  I fear that Sony is doing what they did with the PS2 and is simply hyping it way too much setting the stage for disappointed gamers. If you want my opinion on the matter, I am leaning towards the XBOX 360 but I am also keeping one eye on the PS3 but I am definitely going to buy a Revolution.""]",We can't recognize objects for comparision,We can't recognize objects for comparision
1,microsoft,sony,"wich is better, the Sony play station or the Microsoft XBOX?","For a wide selection, choose PS2. However, XBOX games tend to be of higher graphical quality and performance with minimal loading times in comparison to their counterparts or similar games on PS2. Also, the XBOX online service XBOX Live is far more immersive as a community and tends to lag far less than PS2 online games, since the service is a broadband only community with a full network of proprietary servers. I personally prefer XBOX for its 
superior selection of first person, racing, and online competetive games.

Examples:

FPS: Halo/Halo2, the Rainbow Six series, Half-Life 2

Racing: Project Gotham Racing 1&2, Forza Motorsport, Need for Speed Most Wanted

The only thing I’m worried about is if there are any differences between the PS4 & X1 specs than what I’ve seen so far from other people who own them.

4,microsoft,sony,PS3 or X-BOX 360? We all know that these are the latest platforms by SONY and MICROSOFT. But which is better?,"I'm sure you knew when you posted this that we will not know untill the PS3 is out.
Sony will have to really throw some bombs at E3 this year, last years E3 left me a little disapointed.
This is what they have to say this year.

 ""We have always said that the PlayStation 3 will be playable at this year's E3 and that hasn't changed""
 ""We have a three platform showing this year and of course the PlayStation 2, which is now more popular than ever, will share space with the PSP and the PlayStation 3.""

Xbox 360 is a great console and with Xbox Live their is no way that the 360 will be Dreamcasted with their earley release.

So pretty much I think it all falls down to the on-line play.

A recent article from PSM confirms that Sony is really making a legitimate attempt at taking on Microsoft’s Xbox Live system.
PSM reports that you will be able to see recorded gameplay footage  which includes your achievements and in-game highlights  you will also be able to make your own video blog. This will be recorded with an Eye-Toy like device and can be shared with your friends. Your video blog will also likely support the PSP’s Eye-Toy function, allowing you to upload videos and pictures directly to your PS3.

So if this is true Xbox may have some serious competition.

Me pesonaly, I think the PS3 will be the best.

-------- Edit -----------

NinjaPirate, rumor had it that the PS3 would be arround 610 and 730 dollars.

Sony has now released a statement saying that it would be arround $500, and with the high-definition and Blu-ray disc functionality that would be a good price.

They jumped on this rumor fast so their may not be as much truth to it as we think.

Thank you. @rjejr – The game runs fine on Windows 7, but it’s still missing some features that are available only on Xbox One. For example, when you’re using an external hard drive connected directly via USB 3.0 cable, you’ll see “Read Only Available” instead of “Write Only”. This means that while you could theoretically use the PS4’s internal HDD as storage, there’s nothing stopping you from writing data over USB. However, since the PS3 doesn’t support write caching (which allows files to stay cached), you’ll need to copy everything back onto the external drive."

Will there be an option to play games on both consoles at once? Or can only one console use any game that was purchased for both? Thanks in advance :)   @rjejr – The answer is no, you cannot do that. You must purchase all of your content from Microsoft through their own store. This means if you want to buy Halo 5: Guardians then you’ll need to get it from Microsoft. If you’re looking to download some other games, such as Gears of War 4, then you’ll also need to go through Microsoft’s store which has its own separate section called “Games” where they sell those same titles but without having to pay Microsoft anything. So basically this would mean buying everything from Microsoft, including the game, plus getting them digitally via Steam. Which isn’t exactly what most people are doing these days. But it’s not impossible."

But if you just need something small enough to carry around in your pocket every day, then this tablet will do fine. The screen size makes it easy to read web pages as well as watch videos. It has a very good camera which can take pictures at up to 8 megapixels. You also have access to Google Play Store where many apps like Angry Birds Star Wars Battle Droids etc. are available. This means there is no limit to what you can do. And finally, since it runs Android OS, you don’t even need to worry about viruses because they won’t be able to infect it.

However, if you want to know whether something will take longer than expected, then there may not be any better way of doing it. For example, in my previous post, I showed that adding an extra line at the end of every task can increase its execution time. This means that we should use some kind of heuristics when choosing between different kinds of keyboards. A lot of people have asked me about this, so let us see why. The first thing to notice is that, even though our test was performed on a computer, it still took only 20 seconds per task. On average, most tasks require less than 10 seconds. So, why do they need such short times? Well, one reason could be that programmers often write code which requires very long calculations."

Recent reports are that the AMD is the number one desktop computer sold in the retail market for general home use.  And the best news is that a computer with an AMD processor is generally hundreds of dollars less expensive than one using Intel.

The biggest problem was getting used to having so many different desktop environments running at once, but now it’s second nature. One of the things you can do when installing Ubuntu:   1. Open up your terminal window (you’ll need to use sudo) and type “apt-get install ubuntu-desktop” (without quotes) into the command line. This will create a new user account called ‘username’ which should be enough if you’re not worried about security. Then just run the following commands as root (or not):   2.

A woman bought a Dell laptop for about 900 and left it in her car one night. The computer froze and the screen cracked. Dell said that they would replace the screen for free. So she sent the computer off to Dell. Dell called back and told her that the computer would cost 960 dollars or so to fix. Not replace just fix the screen. The lady wrote Smart Computing and since they have more power than a regular person does and they cleared the issue up for the woman.  This is just one of the many Dell horror stories. Other stories include Dell promising to replace things with new parts only to put refurbished parts in the computer and then the parts burning out shortly after. Dell charging people for things they never bought or charging them for things that were covered under the warranty. The list goes on.

If you look at Intel’s latest CPU roadmap, it’s clear that Intel has no intention of releasing any new CPUs. They want to keep selling processors for as long as possible. This means that there won’t be many changes between now and 2020, when most people will probably buy an i7 7700K instead of an i5. The same goes for AMD. There isn’t going to be anything major happening until AMD releases its next generation APU. And even then, they’ll likely release one that’s not very different from what they’ve already released. So while both companies may make some small tweaks here and there, they’re unlikely to change much. As far as I’m concerned, all these rumors about “new” chips just mean more hype around old ones.

The only thing that the HTC has over my Samsung in terms of camera quality is its flash. But it does not take pictures as well as the Samsung. So if you want to shoot photos with your phone, get yourself one of these cameras for yourself. You will be amazed at how good they are. And then there is the fact that this smartphone can do so much more than just taking photos. It also comes with some really cool features such as Google Now on Tap where you can search by location using voice commands. This feature works very well. If you use Google Now, you should try it. Also, you can set up notifications from any app including WhatsApp. For example, when someone calls you, you can see who called you. Or you can send them a text message saying “Hey Google, call me”. That way you don’t even need to pick up. Just say “Ok Google” and the person on the other end hears a message."

The first thing that comes into my mind when thinking of buying an iPod is how much space it will take up on my computer. If you are going to buy one, then think twice before getting one with such a small hard drive. It takes me hours just to get through all of my music collection, which includes over 2000 songs.

If your goal is to produce a large amount of energy from small amounts of material, then nano cells will be better than regular cells. However, if you want to make more efficient use of energy, then they may not be. In fact, it seems that there has been some debate about whether nanowires can actually do this. One thing we know for sure is that they cannot convert light into electricity at all. This means that even though they might have an efficiency in converting sunlight into electricity, their conversion rate would still be very low. It turns out that these researchers were wrong. Nanowires can indeed convert solar radiation directly into electricity. They just need to get around one problem. Their efficiency falls off as soon as they start using carbon nanotubes. Carbon nanotubes are extremely difficult and expensive materials to work with. So what does this mean for nanobatteries? Well, first off, they can’t store any significant amount of energy. Second, they don’t last long enough to charge up your phone."

If you want a car that will last for years and years, then go with Honda. But if you need something more practical, like a small car, then Toyota would be your best choice.

This means that even though their vehicles may not look as flashy as some of the other Japanese automakers, people can rely on them when it comes time to get into an accident. They also make great family cars. And while there aren’t many American brands out there, most of us know who Ford is. So we don’t feel too bad about buying one from them. You might say that it’s better than having no brand at all. Well, that’s true too. There isn’t much difference between any two brands. It’s just how good each company makes its products."

We went on eBay and found this new Honda. It seemed like such a good deal because it came with all these safety features including airbags. And it also comes with cruise control.

If you want something more sporty, go with Nissan. Both cars have their own advantages and disadvantages. The Nissan has better fuel economy than its competitors, while also being much cheaper in terms of maintenance. It can handle almost any weather condition, including snow. This makes it ideal for those who live in areas where snow falls frequently. Another advantage of the Nissan over Toyota is that they both offer automatic transmission. In addition, there are many other features such as heated seats, power windows, air conditioning, etc. That all adds up to make them great choices. You should always check out your car’s warranty before buying it. Some people think warranties don’t matter because it’s just an expensive way to get rid of old cars. However, most manufacturers provide free repairs on new cars, so this isn’t really necessary. Also, some companies like Honda do give away repair parts when purchasing used vehicles. They even include oil filters and spark plugs."

The Civic’s engine and suspension are both very well tuned for handling on city streets with little to no body roll. It also handles much more smoothly in traffic. However, it lacks some of Honda’s best features like adaptive cruise control that can make you feel as if you’re drifting off into space. Also, it’s not nearly as fun to drive because its steering feels too loose when cornering. On the other hand, the Toyota Prius C offers an excellent balance between ride comfort and handling. Its hybrid system makes it easy to get around town without having to worry about range anxiety. And although it doesn’t have all the bells and whistles of the Honda, it does offer plenty of performance at lower prices. In short, I’d say go with whichever car fits your budget best.

If you want a Honda that is similar to a Corolla I suggest a Civic. A Corolla is more economical than the accord is gas mileage (MPG are city 30 / hwy 38 for automatic and 32 / 41 for manual) there is less room for passengers in the back and has a more sporty american touch which means u can feel the road while driving. An Accord tends to be bought for ride comfort and long trips, which means it has a smoother suspension. BUt if you really want a bang for your money with money in your pocket. My parents bought a Ford Fiver Hunred for less than the money for a Corolla or Accord. It rides better than an Accord. Passenger room in the back can fit 3 grown people comfortably with more leg room in the back than in the front. They have an option where the back seats also recline. The two captain seats in front are elevated for better road handling. Has the best crash star rating which means you save on insurance costs as well. and has room for the whole PGA Tour's golf clubs. I have driven the Corolla, Civic (older version), Accord, and Ford Five Hundred and i would pick easily the Ford Fiver HUndred not because I like American cars more but the value of the vehicle. Road handling is very important and the view from all angles. Corolla's view is awful trying to reverse with a smal window which is similar to the Ford Fusion. Also Accord has troubling blind spots but handles well. But if you're going with looks i would say the Accord has the best out of all of them. And if you want something similar to an Accord that is stylish I do enjoy the Camry's new look from Toyota, but never drove it."", ""The Corolla is a fine built car since the early 80's. books and movies have been made telling about them.

The Honda Accord is the most reliable car there is because of the honor and work they put into the Honda and every other product they make. but there is always those few that slip through that are bad and will defect on you. after owning 13 different American cars and they all failed i cant trust Ford, Dodge or Chevy. this little Accord has 201,783 miles on it and just wont quit! as long as oyu change the oil, get the timing belts and hoses changed when your supposed to then your car will last forever. i used to have a 86 Honda Accord and it never had a problem, we gave it away to a paster with 340,000 miles. i ahve had really good days with the Accord's and i have read so many good things about the Corolla, i would choose a Corolla over an Accord. BUt the final choice is up to you, good luck!"", ""The Corolla is a compact car, and the Accord is a mid size car.

Get the Honda instead - it has a better, proven record  - and the parent company is more stable.', 'There are a lot of differences between the two as Accord would be considered a sedan while Corolla is more of a compact.  They are both incredibly durable, Accord will have more space and performance, while Corolla will get better gas mileage and be a lot cheaper >$5000.']","The honda is better than toyota. 2013 Toyota Camry Advantages The Toyota Camry is softer, simpler and requires a bit of a lighter touch than the Honda Accord."" Better emissions (ULEV rather than LEV) May Hold value better Updated Engine, technology generally Smoother ride than TSX without being as slushy as Toyota/Lexus Bigger, but may be bigger than I need.","   I think the Honda Civic has a better engine and more power than the Toyotas but it also costs more. The Honda's are not as good looking nor do they have the same quality of build that Toyota has. They don't even come close to being worth what you pay for them. If your going to buy one make sure its a Honda. Posted by: Anonymous | May 5, 2014 8:52:08 AM   @Anonymous: You can get an Accord with manual transmission for about $3000 less than a Civic. And if you're willing to put in some work on it, it's actually pretty easy to do. It's just easier to take apart the car and clean it.

They can’t force people into buying another device when they’re already using one. It’s up to Nintendo to decide whether it’s worth selling the Switch as a separate device.

The DS specializes in unique gameplay by using the touch screen and sometime voice capabilities in games such as Nintendogs which I don't even consider to be a game. The PSP beats the DS graphically wise but it depends on what kinds of games you like, the DS has lots of RPGs and cartoony type games but it is targeted at a younger audience.  The PSP has first person shooters and Grand Theft Auto on it with much better graphics and a more serious nature.  There is also SOCOM on the PSP now which I believe includes voice functions as well much like the PS2 version of the game. I don't consider the DS superior capability wise but it does have innovation on its side.  But, if you are looking at pure capabilities and specs, the PSP puts the DS out to pasture.  But the two devices are not directly competing with each other so they are hard to compare but people who are saying the DS is better probably like the games on it better than the PSP but the PSP is superior spec wise."", 'HELL YES DUDE HOW CAN YOU NOT KNOW THAT', 'The compromise is as such: Better overall unit (PSP) vs. More reliable unit (DS)']","The ds is better than psp.

Or do you think it would work out fine as long as i bought them through your site? Thanks in advance :)   @rjejr - The only thing I'm not sure of is whether or not the game can play in PAL regions. It seems like it's possible but I'd need more info before making an official comment. As far as compatibility, yes, all titles should work. However, please note that this is just our experience so far. We don't know how other regions handle these types of games. This was really fun when we were kids, but now its kinda boring. Its great that people enjoy it, but its kind of boring now. Maybe because im older than most people. But overall good game."

If you’re having problems installing it, try using a different USB drive. Also, make sure it’s formatted correctly. For example, if you format it FAT32, you’ll need to reformat it NTFS.

If you want to buy it, wait until it's available at your local retailer. That way you'll get an idea of what you're getting into. And if you don't like it, then return it for something else. I'm not sure why everyone thinks Sony will be able to sell as many consoles as they did last generation. They sold about 3 million PS4s during their first year out. That's less than half of Microsoft's Xbox One sales. It's also far behind Sony's own console which was released two years ago. So yeah, there may still be some room left over but that's because Microsoft had such a huge lead when all those games came out first."
89,ds,psp,"What's the differerance between PSP, Nitendo DS, GameBoy Advance SP?","The PSP is an all around media device that can be used as an player for mp3's and even movie files.  It uses a  proprietary media formats like the Sony Memory Stick for saving data and transferring media between your computer and PSP, and the UMD (Universal Media Disc, think a small DVD in a cartridge) for games and near-DVD quality movies.  It has a wide screen, comes in sleek black, and controls with 2 shoulder buttons, a D-pad, four action buttons, and a commonly hated upon analog nub.  Great looking 3D game play in your pocket, if you like ports and weak sequels of PS2 favorites.

The Nintendo DS is different.  It can connect wirelessly (in person or across the internet) for multiplayer game play, just like the PSP.  Its most striking feature are the system's 2 screens, the bottom screen doubling as a touch screen, similar to touch sensitive screens found on Pocket PCs.  The DS cannot be used as an all encompassing media device like the PSP, but critically (critically, not by sales) it has become a device for playing creative, interactive, and just plain different types of games like the recently released Electroplankton, Animal Crossing DS, and Phoenix Wright: Attorney at Law.  It can control with the familiar D-pad, 2 shoulder, and 4 action buttons, but it can also utilize the built in microphone for voice commands and a palm pilot inspired stylus for use on the touch screen.  It can also play Game Boy Advance games.

The Game Boy Advance was the first back-lit portable handheld for Nintendo, and departed from the Game Boy Advance's ""wide"" design for a clam-shell (which is also what the DS is).  There were a couple of Pokemon games released that connect wirelessly for poke battles, but other than the ability to play both Gameboy Advance games and Gameboy games, it has a library of hundreds, perhaps thousands of games.  However, you'll actually only want to play about 1% of those games.  Both systems are plagued by untold numbers of licensed kiddie schlock that isn't worth the it gets tossed into a year after release, let alone the 30 bucks it would cost to get it new.

In short:
PSP - $250 - Lots of media features and my favorite PS2 franchises on the go.
Nintendo DS - $130 - Nothing but games here, the old favorites from the Gameboy Advance and some quirky, interesting, and fun new things.
Gameboy Advance SP - $80 - A styling Gameboy Advance.  That is back lit.

And of course, the screen resolution isn’t quite as good as DS. I’m not sure what your point is, because both are great handheld gaming systems.

The Vita isn’t going anywhere anytime soon, especially since it’s still selling well in Japan. It’s also worth noting that Sony doesn’t seem to care much about third-party support outside of Japan — as long as you’re willing to pay more money for it, they’ll happily sell it.

92,ds,psp,PSP vs DS?,"Here's some hardcore facts:
I own both PSP and DS (as well as just about all other systems and consoles.)

PSP
Pros:
-Connectable to PCs via USB cables so you can upload videos, games, hacks, cracks, music, plus updates and misc. stuff that you'd want, and can act as a portable hard drive too.
-With the latest updates for the PSP you can browse the internet via WI-FI enabled hot spots or a wireless router.
-PSP also has many movies you can buy on UMDs.

Cons:
-Memory cards can be very bothersome in cost. A 1GB card costs and extra $100. Also the defalt 32M memory card is rather small for music or updates (if you try to get the updates for Wipout Pure your stuck in the mud as you can barely fit 3 out of the current 7 updates on the memory card).
-Battery life currently is very short (7 and 1/2 hours if you’re lucky, usually 5 or 4)
-Very few games as of yet have very little support for the internet features offered for the PSP.

DS:
Pros:
-Touch screen is very innovative and offers a much broader area for future game development. Currently (there are some, but in my opinion) not many games that really use this feature well.
-Two screens is also an interesting step for gaming.
Games (from exp.) very rarely crash and don't have as many graphics glitches as some games are (GTA:LCS) for the PSP.
-Battery life usually lasts for about 6-12 hours.

Cons:
-In comparison with PSP the graphics detail is split between the two screens.
-No internet browser what so ever.
-Not many games (so far) use the WI-FI internet connectivity.

Personally I'd say the PSP is more customizable, but is really only worth the price ($250) if you have your own computer. Half the features require a computer connection.
The DS is more family orientated as there aren't as many M or T rated games as the PSP. Also the price of $150 is more affordable.
Both systems, when using any kind of wireless communication (local or internet) lowers battery life by a very large amount (about 1/2 normal life for both).

If you're having trouble loading it, try turning off the system before starting it. It should work. @11 - There are no problems with saving games from PSP. They just won't work if they were saved while playing the original version. This was confirmed by Sony when we asked them. So it's probably something else going on. @12 - Yes, there is.

I love this game, but there should be more levels so we could do some kind of challenge mode. Also if they make another one, maybe add new characters instead of just using old ones. And also adding more weapons and items to use as well. Like a rocket launcher that shoots out rockets and bullets. It makes it easier to beat the levels. This game is awesome!

95,ds,psp,Which one? Sony PSP or Nintendo DS?,"It all depends on what you are looking for. I have had experience with both and I would have to say neither. If you are wanting to get a handheld system save you money. Within a few months Nintendo is going to release what is called the Nintendo DS Lite in America. It is the same as the Nintendo DS except it is more compact, has better button placement, and the screens are brighter and sharper (same size screens but smaller unit).
At first glance the Sony PSP is better because it is basically a PS2. But there are some things to think about. First off the PSP has fallen short as far as game variety goes. I knows people who have sold theirs because they just don't have that good of a game variety. Another thing is that the black glossy finish on the PSP looks horrible in any sort of light. It picks up fingerprints and oil from your hands horribly. Also its easier to see scratches and such. As far as the harddrive goes, it is rather small and a waste. You may say that its not a problem because it supports memory cards, well memory cards are expensive. Not to mention that the PSP is fairly large...

Ok, about the DS. The current DS is built like a tank. I don't like its design and I don't find it portable. The screens are a little dull in the light also. But this is a Nintendo product so it will be innovative, right? Right. DS means that it has Dual Screens, one regular screen on the top and one touch screen on the bottom. This really rocks because you can control your character and do many things with a touch screen. There are quite a few good games for the DS too and the DS plays Game Boy Advance games. Metroid Hunters is a good action game and it is playable online too. Thats another thing, the DS has built in WI-FI so all you need to do is be at a HotSpot (Mcdonalds have these) or by a wireless network. If you don't have a wireless network in your house you can buy a small adaptor that plugs into any standard USB and sends out a wireless network. But as I said earlier, the DS Lite will be the way to go. So here's the rundown:

1st Place: Nintendo DS Lite

Sony is a superior hardware manufacturer, much better than both Nintendo and Microsoft.Nintendo also promised the definitive online experience, bringing online content to you faster and better than Microsoft or Sony.","   I think the Wii U has a lot of potential and it will be interesting to see how they market it. Nintendo seems like an old company that hasn't really changed much since its first console in 1985. They are still making games for their system but have been focusing on mobile gaming with Mario Kart 8 and other games. The only thing new about them lately was the WiiU. If you look at what they've done recently it's not all bad. They've made some good games, such as Super Smash Bros. Melee which had great graphics, amazing sound, and gameplay mechanics that were very innovative. But there isn't anything groundbreaking going on. And that's why people don't buy them. People want more than just another game system. So far Nintendo's biggest success so far is the 3DS because it doesn't do too much. It does things well enough though that most gamers seem to enjoy playing it, even if they're not crazy about it. It's also one of those systems where everyone can play together. That's something that Sony can't do."

In any case, I'm not sure why people keep saying that Nintendo doesn't make great games. They certainly do. It's just that, as far as I've seen, they don't seem to do much with it.

You can write all kinds of cool stuff without using C, but if you need something that’s dependent on C, then you’ll probably want to go C.   > I’m not sure what you mean by “less powerful”. There isn’t really much difference between having a single function call per file vs one function calling every file. In fact, there aren’t even many differences at all. This is true when comparing languages which support multiple functions as opposed to just one. For example, Python supports two functions, while Java allows up to four."

But the only thing that bothers me about it is how slow it is. It takes forever to load up games like pokemon red and blue. And when you get in a game it lags for a second.

It seems like most of these changes were made by Nintendo, rather than third-party developers. However, there was one major change made by third party developers that wasn't mentioned anywhere else in Nintendo's announcement. This change involves the use of stereoscopic 3D. While it's still unclear exactly when this feature will come out, we do now know that it won't require any special hardware from your Wii, so you'll simply need a compatible TV."

The 360 has awesome games, and the graphics match those of the PS3. Developers have said time after time that the difference between the PS3 and 360 are so minor, that no one will be able to notice them. Since I'm not interested in playing Blu-Ray movies, and since I'm interested in the games that the 360 has, I'd get the 360. And even if you don't like the games right now, the 360 will have more games than the PS3 and Wii combined for probably a year (I said combined, it will always have more games than either of the two, or at least the PS3 because it's so hard to dev for), and that means more variety. The DS, is a handheld gaming system. I have a PSP, and I must say, it feels more than a console than a handheld. You might think that's a good thing, but it's not if you want a PORTABLE. With the DS, there are games where you can just pick up and play, AND games that you can play for a long time. I have a PSP, so I know what the games feel like. Since I'm not interested in sports games because you've played on (in a certain sport), you've played them all, I have other games. There are a few exceptions though, like Daxter. Daxter is a nice little platformer that you can play anytime you want, while Metal Gear Acid doesn't allow saves until you beat an hour long mission. Now, the PSP's advantage, special features. Let's start first with web browsing. What a useless feature! It takes forever to type in what you want, and then when you get to a page, it appears all messed up because of the size of the PSP screen. The DS web browser, which comes out next month in Japan, from what I have seen, is a breeze. When you want to type an adress, you use the bottom screen to type in letters by touching, which is much easier. While browsing, the bottom screen provides a overview of the page, and the top screen provides a close up of the space the browser is centered on. It's much easier to use. Music and movies, since I don't have a music player, this might be useful to me. But then, I can just go to the store and buy a 1 gig MP3 player for $30-$50. I don't see music and movies as something very important, but it's up to you. Graphics, the PSP graphics are stunning. The PSP is great at displaying 3D images, and is near PS2 quality. The DS on the other hand is slightly better than the N64. I'd say a bit below DreamCast level. The DS has great games to make up for the step ahead the PSP is in graphics though. The PSP has mostly multiplatform titles and ports of PS2 games though, and some PSP exclusive games are no longer exclusive. GTA: Liberty City Stories is an example, a PS2 version ships two weeks from now. Well, that's my opinion, I'm trying to be as unbiased as possible. I don't own any next generation consoles, or Xbox 360, since that's the only next-gen console that's out, but I do have both handhelds."", ""ds- it is more innovative, and for proof it is killing psp i sales you cant judge between the last three. all will be great as far as graphics but i'm getting a revolution(aka Wii) because it offers a more immersive experience."", ""DS just rocks.

Also, there are many free apps available online that let you download movies onto the device as well. @11 – It’s true that the PSP does support UMD discs, however it’s only compatible with certain models due to licensing issues. This means that you’ll need to purchase a new model (PSP 2000 or later) before using any other type of disc drive.

I prefer the DS Lite as it is more aesthetically beautiful then the Sony PSP.  The glossiness of it makes it very attractive and it's screen is superb and could pump up twice as many lumens as the Sony PSP screen i believe. the battery life is also incredible.
Nintendo games advantages for the DS is that there is little loading time, the max being only a couple second compared to the up to 30 second loading time for the psp.  Also, future upgrades for the DS will allow you to surf the web on it and  watch tv on it, live streaming.
The cartridge system also works very well for the DS, not to mention it has many popular games.  Final Fantasy 3 is scheduled to launch for the DS real soon.
The Nintendo DS also features a ""Picto-CHat"" allowing you to chat with other people by infrared communications i believe.  Also, you can ""DS Download Play"" allowing you to ""download a sliver of a game"" from your buddies so you can always play multiplayer.
The DS is much cheaper, and doesn't scratch as easily thanks to it's protective folding.  Also, the microphone in the DS allows you to talk in some games.

I hear that the DS is BETTER than sony.Psp is way better than Nintendo Ds!," I have a ps4 and it works fine on my tv. @rjejr The reason why the PS3 has been able to sell so well in Japan is because of its exclusive titles like Uncharted, Killzone, etc. Sony needs to make more games that are not only for Japanese audiences, but also appeal to Western audiences as well. They need to start making some good third-party games, too. If they want to be successful overseas, then their first priority should be to get better at developing these games. As far as the Wii U goes, I'm sure it's going to do well, especially with all those new 3rd party titles. But if Nintendo wants to keep up with Sony, they'll probably end up having to release fewer hardware releases than before. And that's just sad. @rjejr You don't know what you're talking about. It's called marketing. It doesn't matter how many people buy your game if you can't advertise it. That's where most companies fail. Not everyone can afford an ad campaign."

117,ds,psp,whats better a psp or a nintedo ds.?,"Meh, most of you guys don't even give valid reasons.

""I like a PSP better than a DS personally beacuse im able to play my favorite childhood games like SNES, SEGA, ATARI, NEO-GEO etc.""
Why, PSP has no games of it's own? I'm sure you really enjoy illegally emulating games. If you had a DS, then you'd be playing new, fresh games, not old games, or PS2 ports.

""Well, I personally think the touch screen is just stupid.""
Have you tried any games that use the feature well? I think you've never touched a DS in your life. Go play Metroid Prime Hunters, it makes a great use of the touch screen, it uses it to make a FPS game possible on the DS. And the touch screen is not the only feature, there is the microphone too. The microphone is used for voice chat with friends on Metroid Prime Hunters, and many other things in Nintendogs.

""The PSP costs more, but it has better hardware and you can also surf the web, listen to music, and watch videos in addition to playing games. The DS is cheaper, but from what I have heard, the games are better.""
Exactly, you're paying an extra $80-$100 for extra junk. And you can have those features on the DS too. There is a web browser coming out in Japan next month (probably comes out a month or two later) for $30, and there are already some third party media players, like the GBA Movie Player from lik-sang.com, it plays movies and music like the PSP, and it can be used on the GBA SP, plus it only costs $25, and uses either compact flash or SD cards. DS Lite + Web Browser + GBA MP = $180, $20 cheaper than PSP, and has all the extra junk. Plus when the DS Lite comes out in the US (June 11th), most likely there will be an original DS price drop. If the price drops, then you save even more money, and you get great games to play too.

""I havent use the DS much, but I dont think you can do as much with it as you can a PSP. PSP gets my vote for sure.""
Yes you can, explained above.

""The psp can do much more, but in my opinion the DS has had much better games and more of them. Just my opinion though.""

Every platform, except maybe GBA, has Need for Speed. The PSP just has a graphically suprerior one. Besides, what's so good about Need for Speed? Just the same rehashed gameplay (drive cars, blah blah) used over and over again with few differences. Metroid Prime Hunters sold much better than NFS, because it was new. MPH puts a working FPS game, and a great FPS game, onto a handheld. Graphics don't make a game, and I already covered the part about NFS being a great game. And the DS is NOT kiddy. You're just biased. Don't forget, games like GTA sell very well because of kids. Kids want to look mature, while adults don't care. If kids want to look mature, they'd get the PSP.

So far, no U.S. or European release has been mentioned[15][16], but screens of an English version and promotional material have been released at E3.' Import it if you want internet.

And what killer games are you talking about? You mean the ports from the PS2? Yea those are real killer games, especially when I can play them on my PS2 also.

In Japan alone the sales of the DS are 2-3 times that of the PSP.  Now, regarding the titles available : The gaming market in Asia is the biggest in the world by far. And since the DS has outsold the PSP in Asia my a large percentage, and since a VERY large no. of developers and publishers are from and focus on Asia-- There Are more DS titles than PSP.

Third, PSP hardware is way better than DS, but DS gives you two screens, stylus, and built-in microphone, and don't forget that DS's able to play GBA games.

Since PS2 has bigger market. I won't say who's the winner, PSP or DS since I'm afraid it will cloud your judgment. But currently DS sells more than PSP. The final decision is yours.

But, those days are over, you're left with Nintendo and now Sony. 

Now, i've used both a DS and a PSP, and the both had thier good points. For starters, DS is Nintendo..a name that's got history, and Sony, they're known for the hip/cool devices. I quite honestly picked a PSP up over a DS becuause the PSP was a sleek unit that i thought a guy my age should carry, vs the DS which looks like it was made for kids and didn't have that flair the PSP did...i didn't wanna be caught sitting on the subway playing a DS.

not to say it isn't good. If you want a lot of the nintendo franchises, it's great. A few of the games that use the touch screen are good, however, i find having to use the screen as a coontrol device in some games is just completely awkard...the PSP has a thumb sick....rock.

the PSP is also not a gaming only device like it's nintendo counterpart. It's got music, movies, both have wifi..with the DS supporting more actual online play than the PSP, which whlile has the ability..i believe the wifi has only ever been used for head-to-head..which is kind of a waste.

I can tell you graphics wise, the PSP's got it. Using a slightly modified PS2 graphics core, the visuals are stunning and a beauty to behold. The DS' graphics are just about on-par with the N64....this is because the DS is only about as powerful as that, plus the usage of memory cards limits what they can do.

UMD's are nice...however, i do remember having problems with one or two of the cases breaking, leaving the games practically unprotected and having to handle the disc to stick it in a case just to play....but they offer a LOT of room so they can do some nice things with the graphics and sound...vs the DS which uses mflash-like technolgy.

Brawl, then yes, there will be more expensive versions than others. But that’s all we can do at this point. We can’t compare prices between systems until after launch. This game looks awesome!

If you want a light weight laptop that can handle most tasks and do it well, then go with the lightest of ultrabooks. However, if you need something more powerful than that, but still have some portability for everyday use, then go with the larger models. The smaller models will be fine for people who just use their laptops at home as well as work (email, web browsing, etc). But if you plan to travel often, get one of those bigger ones. They also come in different sizes so make sure you know which size fits your needs best. Which model should I get: Asus Zenbook UX31A or MacBook Air 13″ Mid 2015? There really isn’t much difference between these two models, other than size. Both offer similar specs and both run Windows 10 Pro. In fact, they even share the same processor, although there may not be any noticeable performance differences when running multiple applications simultaneously."

129,ds,psp,Whats better? DS Lite or PSP?,"PSP is a nice piece of kit with mp3 player, video player, umd player (movies) , wi fi , basic interet, store photos. But the games are pretty much the same as PS2 games.

Nintedo DS lite is not as powerful as the PSP. It has wi fi play and just plays games. However it has a touch screen which changes the way you play games.plus two screens which is very interesting. But the DS has no other extras its just good for orignal games. Games are also £5 - £10 cheaper on the DS. The DS lite is also cheaper. DS games are quick to play on the go and are easy to pick up and play.

The bottom line is the DS lite offers alot of unique games that are not on any other console or the games play alot better due to the touch screen. 90% of the PSP's games are on the PS2 and they play better on the PS2 BUT the PSP is a nice gadget and the games are still good.

DS Lite is absolutely rubbish', 'PSP!', ""I prefer the PSP.   The reason why it hasn't taken off is b/c it's typically more expensive than the DS Lite (which is geared more towards kids and broke students). The PSP is technologically more advanced than the DS Lite...it's like PS1.5 packed into a tiny unit (in other words, almost as powerful as a PS2). The nice thing about the PSP is that it has multiple capabilities...your husband will love using it not only as a game unit, but for viewing AVI movies, for which the PSP is still the best portable for that purpose (topping out the iPod video and its tiny little screen).       I bring the PSP with me to the gym to catch up on t.v., and also on long airplane flights.    Some minor points to worry about: 1)   To make use of either the DS Lite or PSP while he's in the gym or on a plane, he will need a pair of noise-isolation earbuds from either etymotic or shure.     That'll cost anywhere from an extra $100-$200.    2)  The PSP requires an extra memory card to do all the fancy movie stuff.    1 GB memory stick duo pro runs about $60 on sale, and the 2 GB is....$80 on sale?    Keep your eyes peeled for sales at frys or best buy, etc.  The DS Lite is not without its merits...it has good group games but that doesn't sound like something your husband is going to be involved with.      One great game that's entertaining that I've tried is Trauma Center, you can get that off of Amazon but none of the retail stores sell it anymore.      I have both systems, I like the PSP better.    For people who are working, it's just the better alternative even if the numbers in sales don't reflect that. I just bought a bunch of titles 2 weeks ago, here are some that you might want to get for him: Lumines Lumines 2 Syphon Filter:  Dark Mirror  (fun!  Playing it now....)

So if your looking for an amazing handheld gaming system, then get a psp or xbox. If not, go ahead and wait until next year when Sony will release their new handheld. @rjejr You can use any game on the Vita. Just make sure it's in English (that's what we do here in the UK). Also, there are many great indie titles coming out this year. Check them out. :)   @rjejr Well said. I've been playing some Vita games recently and I'm really impressed. In fact, I'd say they're even better than PS3 games. It's just too bad there's only one version available right now."

132,ds,psp,which is better ds or psp?,"It all depends on what you want to do.  If you want to play games, listen to music, watch movies, etc...then you'll want a PSP, simply because the DS doesn't do those things.  If you're looking simply for a handheld gaming console, go with the DS--the touchscreen is just so cool to use and it's awesome to see how different developers incorporate that feature into their games.  In addition, there are a lot of good games spanning a wide variety of genres for the DS.  That's not to say the PSP didn't have good games--it just didn't have enough to make it a good gaming investment (my roommate returned his after playing Mercury and MegaMan Maverick Hunters).

And in my personal opinion, the PSP felt a little bulky in my hands, and the little ""nub"" it's got (that's somehow supposed to substitute for a control stick) is hard to use with the precision that the games require.

Games you should check out for the DS to get you started:
Meteos - falling brick-style puzzle game, easy to learn and unending difficulty potential
Tetris DS - well...it's Tetris.  'Nuff said.
MarioKart DS - it's MarioKart, and you can't go wrong there, either.
New Super Mario Bros - A complete reimagining of the 2D platformer, incredible nostalgic value on this one.
Starfox Command - great combat flyer and good use of the touchscreen.
Metroid Prime Hunters - it's like Metroid Prime, but with other cool bounty hunters and multiplayer.
Brain Age - an amusing educational game that is supposed to activate the prefrontal cortex in your brain.  Basically keeps parts of your mind active that don't do much once you're out of school--it's fun if you're into that kind of thing.
Nintendogs - it's a really fancy Tamagotchi (remember those?)--you have a little puppy that you feed and play with and stuff.  I've heard it's fun, anyway.

Those should get you started, there are tons more and of course what you play is all dependant upon your tastes.
http://www.gamestop.com/ - if you search through their list of DS games, you'll probably find something else that looks cool, too.

It's addictive."", 'Psp the disks are cool, Madden 07 midnight club3 dub edition Gun  Cars Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories NBA 07 Miami Vice', 'The PSP is the better then the DS', 'Both of the systems have their pros and cons.   The main things to look at in a hand-held video game system are: graphics, features, games, price, and durability. Your age is also a factor in deciding which one you would enjoy the most. Both systems are really fun but, nine times out of ten one will suit you more than the other.   Nintendo DS:   Pros: The price is the first thing to look at. The price is currently $129.99. This is a fair price for what you get. First, it has a built-in Game Boy Advance. The price of a Game Boy Advance SP on its own is $79.99. That means that the DS part is only $50. The DS has great graphics for its price! That is not all, it even has two screens. One is a regular screen, but the other is touch screen. It is used for anything from petting a dog to aiming a gun. Last, but not least, you can play online. This means that if you have a wireless router at home you can play for free. If you do not have a wireless router, you can pay $35 for an adapter.  Online you can race, shoot and play with people across the world.   Cons: If you are looking for more mature, traditional gaming, the DS will probably disappoint you.  The Nintendo DS offers a wide selection of innovative games that focus on using the touch screen.  The touch screen is both a pro and a con.  In the game “Greg Hastilings Tournament Paintball Max,” aiming with the touch screen while pressing buttons to fire and reload can be a pain.  One other issue with the touch screen is that the stylus is easy to lose.  DS comes with two of them, but you can purchase three more for around $5.00.         Sony PSP: Pros: Sony PSP is a sleek, nice looking, hand-held gaming system made by Sony. It is designed to attract the “I-pod audience.” This system can connect to the internet, play movies, hold photos, and play music. The PSP has graphics similar to the Play Station 2[1].  The games look really nice on the PSP. This system is the only hand-held system to have a mini built-in joystick. The joystick is so small that you can barely see it in pictures, but it works really well.  The stick makes racing, shooting, and walking a lot easier. PSP also has arrow keys for tasks such as moving through menus, entering text, and performing more precise functions. As if that were not enough, this work of art can connect to the internet, and surf the web.   Cons:  Every positive on the PSP comes with a negative.  The games offered on the PSP aren’t very innovative.  Most of the games have previous versions which appear on other TV based systems (Nintendo Game Cube, Microsoft Xbox (360), and Sony Play Station 2).  The ones on the TV based systems are usually longer and easier to navigate because their controllers have more , larger buttons. Music and photo storage are cool features, but are limited by the PSP’s memory.  If you want to store more than five songs or ten pictures you would have to buy a memory stick, which can cost between $30 - $100.  You can buy movies to play on the PSP, but many movies don’t come in this format.  There is software that converts regular DVDs to the PSP format, but this costs around $40, and requires at least an $80 memory card.  The movie Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith, for example, took up one gigabyte of memory!  The Internet connection is a great idea, but it’s really hard to navigate.  It’s difficult to enter text, but it’s even more difficult to correct mistakes.  The last point is that the screen breaks very easily.  A good, hard screen protector costs an additional $15, but it’s well worth it.      Conclusion: Overall, they both have many great features and some drawbacks.  It all comes down to which system you prefer.  If you are attracted to new technology developments, then you are a Nintendo DS person.  If you enjoy more traditional, familiar games then Sony PSP is for you.', ""It all depends on what you want to do.  If you want to play games, listen to music, watch movies, etc...then you'll want a PSP, simply because the DS doesn't do those things.  If you're looking simply for a handheld gaming console, go with the DS--the touchscreen is just so cool to use and it's awesome to see how different developers incorporate that feature into their games.  In addition, there are a lot of good games spanning a wide variety of genres for the DS.  That's not to say the PSP didn't have good games--it just didn't have enough to make it a good gaming investment (my roommate returned his after playing Mercury and MegaMan Maverick Hunters). And in my personal opinion, the PSP felt a little bulky in my hands, and the little 'nub' it's got (that's somehow supposed to substitute for a control stick) is hard to use with the precision that the games require. Games you should check out for the DS to get you started: Meteos - falling brick-style puzzle game, easy to learn and unending difficulty potential Tetris DS - well...it's Tetris.  'Nuff said. MarioKart DS - it's MarioKart, and you can't go wrong there, either. New Super Mario Bros - A complete reimagining of the 2D platformer, incredible nostalgic value on this one. Starfox Command - great combat flyer and good use of the touchscreen. Metroid Prime Hunters - it's like Metroid Prime, but with other cool bounty hunters and multiplayer. Brain Age - an amusing educational game that is supposed to activate the prefrontal cortex in your brain.  Basically keeps parts of your mind active that don't do much once you're out of school--it's fun if you're into that kind of thing. Nintendogs - it's a really fancy Tamagotchi (remember those?)--you have a little puppy that you feed and play with and stuff.  I've heard it's fun, anyway. Those should get you started, there are tons more and of course what you play is all dependant upon your tastes. http://www.gamestop.com/ - if you search through their list of DS games, you'll probably find something else that looks cool, too.

This whole thing has been so annoying and now we cant even get our money back from it. You guys should be ashamed of yourselves. @11 – The only reason why people buy PSP over PS3 is due to its superior hardware specs. It also features better battery life than PSP. And if Sony can release a handheld with similar specs as PS Vita, they will sell more units in Japan alone. So what you’re saying is, “People who bought PSP’s don’t care about other people’s opinions when they’re buying their console.” Well, that’s not true. They care. But it’s still irrelevant since there isn’t any way to force them."

That is the usual problem with these types of multi-task devices; they do many different things, but none of them well. As an mp3 player the PSP is one of the larger and more difficult to use and you have to buy expensive Sony memory sticks to expand the memory of the system. As a movie player the PSP is a joke.  Let's think about this for a minute.  Who is going to sit in front of this thing for 2 hours to watch a movie?  Answer:  no one.  This novelty will wear off about 45 minutes into your first movie.  Don't forget that if you want to watch one of your favorite movies, you have to spend another 15 to 20 bucks to buy it on a UMD.  The UMD is failing miserably and probably won’t be around much longer.  Studios are losing money and will not continue the production of these disks soon. With some modification and downloads, you can surf the web wirelessly (although not very well; another novelty that will be as useless as watching movies after about 10 minutes) as well as download and store all kinds of media in the device.(buy a video ipod for this instead).  **********End Rant**********  it all boils down to the games.  Nintendo has dominated the handheld market for 10 years because they know handhelds are mainly for younger players and produce the majority of their games accordingly. Adults simply don’t have as much time to play mobile games.  When we go somewhere (adults), it is for a reason, not because we are being dragged by our parents and need something to pass the time.

And I’m struck that this discussion has focused almost entirely on what happens when you stop paying your mortgage. But if you’re thinking of retiring from work, you’ve probably also thought about whether you’ll still need Social Security benefits after you retire. You may not realize it, but there was another big reason why many Americans didn’t save enough during their working years: they were worried about debt."

If you’re looking for something more immersive than just watching videos and playing games, then go with the Vive. But if you’re looking for an experience that’s closer to being in the real world, like walking around your neighborhood at night without having to worry about getting mugged, then opt for the Rift. The Rift has been designed specifically as a virtual reality device, so it offers some of those benefits but also comes with its own set of drawbacks. For example, it’s not very comfortable compared to other devices. And while the Oculus Touch controllers are great for interacting with objects within VR, they don’t offer much tactile feedback. In my experience, though, I’ve found that people who have tried both devices agree that they’re pretty similar. Both systems let me move freely through space, which makes them ideal for exploring new places — especially when combined with a smartphone camera. That said, there are differences between them."

The DS, while it can really only play games, has the innovative touch screen, which enhances the way some games are played. It's not really a question of which system is better - it's a question of what do you WANT your portible system to do.

For someone like me, though, who would hardly EVER use any of the other features available on the PSP and would use it primarily to play games (depending on what games you want to play) the DS is less expensive and there are plenty of fun games available to for it.  Another question to ask is who is the system for because the PSP is geared mostly towards an older crowd with more violent games being available for it. The DS is geared for everyone with a lot of games made for a younger crowd and the community of gamers that like puzzle/thinking/strategy games.  Both systems are awesome if you ask me.

152,ds,psp,Which is the better handheld game now PSP or Nintendo DS?,"The ds is better than the psp

Ten reasons why a ds is better than a psp

1) Most of the ds games are original and only released for that format - nearly all the psp games have been also released (or due to be released) on the ps2. 

2) The ds is a lot more reliable - psp's are too fragile.

3) The psp is more interested in graphics than game content. Game content is much more important to me than graphics.  I can spend hours playing the awesome highly addictive game Pong on my ds (one of the games on Retro Atari) which much more fun than some of them psp games.  Big suprise Pong is not out on the psp. 

4) The batteries on a psp dont last as long as a ds's.

5) There are too many 'add ons' on a psp that are not necassary for a games console while a ds just does what a games console is designed to do which is play games.

6) More ds consoles have been sold than psp's.

7) The ds has awesome wireless multiplayer action and only one of the players need to have the game

8) The ds has awesome touch screen technology and built in microphone which a lot of ds games take full advantage off.

9) There are more games out on a ds than a psp.

His favorite feature of the A7 series is the ability to shoot 4K video, which he does frequently.

Yeah I think the Nintendo Revolution is going to do significantly worse than the Gamecube b/c the other two systems will be so much more expensive, and the games will be more expensive, leaving people to be less willing to buy the Revolution.The N64 is the gretest revolution in Nintendo history, except for the Wii, because it intoduced true 3-D graphics, better games, and better everything else, the only thing greater than it is the Wii, the gamecube is still good though.","   I think the revolution was a good idea, but it didn’t work out for Nintendo. The Wii U has been an amazing console and it’s still going strong. Nintendo should have just stuck with what they had worked on in the past instead of trying to make something new. They were not successful at making games that would appeal to people who already owned their systems. If you want to play old games, then buy them from your local store. Don’t try to force everyone else into buying new games. You will never sell as many copies if you do that. @rjejr Well said. I remember when the GameCube came out, and how excited we all were. We thought this thing could change gaming forever. But after playing it, I’m sad to say that it didn’t. It wasn’t until Mario Kart 8 Deluxe did things start looking up. And even then, only because there are so few great racing games available right now. It’s like every other game that’s coming out now is either too hard or way too easy.

You mentioned that your company was founded as an open source project. How did this come about?

You can then make your own decision. If you decide on apple, it will probably cost a bit more than if you choose microsoft. But in my opinion, there are many advantages with apple. For example, they have an excellent support team who really cares about their customers. They also offer great products at very reasonable prices. And finally, they do not require any special software to use it. In fact, most people don’t even need to install anything from them. This means that users get access to all kinds of useful applications without having to download anything. So, when choosing between these two companies, which one should you choose?

Windows phones are more open than macs, which means there's less chance someone will steal them. And yes, i know about all these other OS's, too.

The UI looks like it was designed by someone who has never used an iPhone. It feels very clunky and not at all intuitive. And there are many things that just don’t work as they should. For example, when you open up your Messages app, instead of showing me my recent calls, it’s always showing me my last 10 calls. This makes no sense. Why can’t we see what people call me? Also, why do I need to go through so much trouble to get back to where I left off? It’s ridiculous. I’m sure Apple will fix these issues in future updates, but right now they’re really annoying. My biggest problem though is how slow everything is. When you’re using apps on this phone, there’s literally nothing else running except for the phone. Everything takes forever to load. Even simple tasks take forever. If I want to check something online, I’ll wait until the phone decides whether or not it’s going to load it.

Let's analyze. Companies like Samsung, LG etc are basically consumer electronics companies. Their product line ranges from TVs to DVD players on one side and mobile phone to CD/DVD writers on the other. They also assemble PCs and manufacture LCD/Plasma screens. For example, a company like LG focuses most of its attention (and resources) to LCD screens and Plasma TVs as it is a high profit business. For them mobile phone is an instrument to complete their product line.

On the other hand, companies like Nokia and Motorola are pure communication companies. They are the ones that develop new technologies like Bluetooth, MMS etc. Since their core activity (and their means of earning their bread and butter) is wireless communication, their mobile phones will always be most customer friendly. Moreover, their after sales service would also be comparatively better to companies like Samsung, LG etc.

However, the choice of a mobile phone is very personal and individualistic. Therefore, one will have to look at what one needs to buy rather than what the companies want to sell.

And the best news is that a computer with an AMD processor is generally hundreds of dollars less expensive than one using Intel.

By the way I do use a apple, but I am also a graphic artist hope this helps :)"", ""Compaq computer's are the best but I love Sony computers."", 'It will be much easier to find software for the Dell.']","The apple is better than dell. It's the Operating System which matters to the user and, as an Apple computer user I shall still enjoy a vastly superior interface and better build quality than the Dell-boys and Windows.The MBP15 will still get better battery life than the stock L501x, it's slightly lighter and definitely thinner, and some will prefer the Apple styling.","   I have a Dell Latitude E6420 and it works fine with my MacBook Pro Retina 15″ running 10.8.4. The only thing that bothers me about the laptop is its weight. It weighs almost 4 pounds more than my old HP laptop. But that’s not really an issue for me. My main concern was battery life. With the new battery, I’m getting around 3 hours of continuous use on a full charge. That’s pretty good considering how much power this machine has. And it’s still lighter than most other ultrabooks out there. If you want to know what else makes up your computer, check out our list below. Best Ultrabook Laptop 2018 – Lenovo Yoga C930   This one might be the best budget option in terms of performance. It’s got all the features you’d expect from a high-end laptop like 4GB RAM, 128GB SSD, i7 processor, etc. However, if you’re looking for something light, portable and powerful, then look no further. You can get this model at just $999."

196,apple,dell,"wich computer is better, apple or dell?","lol @ pc's are vulnerable to viruses, spyware etc etc. I agree apples are great but it isnt the pc itself that gets the viruses , it is the OS aka operating system that you use and for the most part most people use windows on pc's ( Aside from gurus or people who tinker ) and they use some distrobution of linux ie suse, ubuntu, kubuntu, red hat etc ( As there are a lot of them about ).

Even mac os x ( with the new release of there intel dual core systems ) are getting targeted by hackers etc for worms and such like ( which isnt such a bad thing ) because then mac os x will get more patches and in the long run will make it a better OS.","[""lol @ pc's are vulnerable to viruses, spyware etc etc. I agree apples are great but it isnt the pc itself that gets the viruses , it is the OS aka operating system that you use and for the most part most people use windows on pc's ( Aside from gurus or people who tinker ) and they use some distrobution of linux ie suse, ubuntu, kubuntu, red hat etc ( As there are a lot of them about ).\n\nEven mac os x ( with the new release of there intel dual core systems ) are getting targeted by hackers etc for worms and such like ( which isnt such a bad thing ) because then mac os x will get more patches and in the long run will make it a better OS."", ""lol @ pc's are vulnerable to viruses, spyware etc etc. I agree apples are great but it isnt the pc itself that gets the viruses , it is the OS aka operating system that you use and for the most part most people use windows on pc's ( Aside from gurus or people who tinker ) and they use some distrobution of linux ie suse, ubuntu, kubuntu, red hat etc ( As there are a lot of them about ).

You are saying that a company like Dell doesn't guarantee every single hardware and software component that they include with there computers, I know first hand they do a good if not better then Apple customer service.So apparently Apple can't just be better AND cheaper than Dell, they also have to be cheaper than the CHEAPEST PCs... and still better than Dell.","   I think the answer to this question depends on what you are looking for. If you want a laptop that can do everything and then some but still be portable enough for daily use, go with apple. You will not regret it. However, if you just need something light weight that does basic tasks well like word processing, surfing the web, watching videos etc. Go with Dell. They have an excellent reputation in their line of business laptops. The only thing they lack compared to Apple is touch screen. Dell has great customer service as well. Their laptops come with 3 year warranty which means you get your money back after 2 years from date of purchase. This also includes accidental damage coverage. In conclusion, it all comes down to personal preference. For me, my preference was always apple, until i found out about dell inspiron. It had exactly what i wanted at a price point that was affordable. So far so good. Thanks for reading my post. Please share any comments or questions below 🙂   About Me   Hi there!"

If you want a laptop that can handle most of your everyday computing needs, then go with apple. But if you just need something for school and some light gaming, get a dell. The best part about dell laptops is their reliability. They have been around since the early 90s so they know how to make them. And Dell has always had great customer service. You will never be disappointed by any product from dell, even though it may not look like it. This article was written in response to an email asking me why my computer didn’t come with Windows 7. My reply was:   “While I’m sure it’s nice having all these new features, there isn’t anything really special about them compared to XP which came out years ago. It’s still pretty much the same operating system as before. It doesn’t offer many features over XP, but at least it works without crashing."

This isn’t really acceptable at all. If you are going to sell something as powerful as this, then make sure it’s reliable. You can also get a MacBook Air which has better specs but costs more.
