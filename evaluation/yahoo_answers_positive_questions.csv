microsoft,sony,which next-gen console is the best NITENDO SONYS  PS3 - MICROSOFT XBOX 360?,How can you even ask this question yet? Only the Xbox 360 is out at the moment and that hasn't even been tested by gamers enough to see truely how good or rubbish it is. You need to ask the question again when all three systems are out!,How can you even ask this question yet? Only the Xbox 360 is out at the moment and that hasn't even been tested by gamers enough to see truely how good or rubbish it is. You need to ask the question again when all three systems are out!,"The story I keep hearing is that Nintendo's Revolution will play all the old Nintendo games from most of their different consoles.  For me, that sells it more than anything.  Being able to play Super Mario 3, then go to Super Mario 64, then go to Need for Speed Underground all on the same box would be awesome.","They all have their strengths and weeknesses.  Its really more or less a view of personal choice.  More then likely people will have multiple next generation consoles when they can afford it (400 dollars for one, 400 dollars for another, with the Nitendo being the cheapest but mostly being considered too kidish based to many).  They all have backwards compatibility in a way, Xbox will have a emulator, Ps3 will just have backwards capatibility from the get go, and even Nitendo I believe.  What it comes down to though is the games, which is why people will own many console systems in the future.  The first Xbox may of been better with graphics, but it wasn't enough to lure everybody from the Ps2 simply because the Ps2 had some damn awesome games.  We'll see how the games fan out, 18 games for the Xbox 360 /NOW/ isn't enough to go crazy over.  Save your money until you can tell which is better by who has the best games that you absolutely must have.","I don't think anyone can really that answer yet since all we have seen is the XBOX 360.  It also depends on what you look for in a console and what type of games you like.  The XBOX 360 seems to be heavy on First Person shooters and racing games.  While the XBOX 360 is powerful and has a 3 core processor, Sony keeps hyping its own Cell processor and 512MB custom GPU from nVidia. As the XBOX 360 and PS3 are going head to head it will be hard to make a final decision on this until both consoles are seen side by side but there is still no good way to directly compare them. The Nintendo Revolution has less horsepower than both the PS3 and XBOX 360 but Nintendo is hoping to wow you with their unique controller and games.  The Revolution is not hyping HD content as is the PS3 and Nintendo says the Revolution will have approximately double the specs of the GameCube. While the XBOX 360 and PS3 are around $400 or more the Revolution will be $99 to $149 at launch.  I don't care what walk of life you come from, $149 (despite the lack of power) is an excellent price considering the premiums of the PS3 and XBOX 360. You will have the PS3 only camps and the XBOX 360 camps and the Revolution camps.  Some will want both the 360 and PS3, some will only want the Revolution and some will want all three. In the end it comes down to 'which console meets your demands'.  I fear that Sony is doing what they did with the PS2 and is simply hyping it way too much setting the stage for disappointed gamers. If you want my opinion on the matter, I am leaning towards the XBOX 360 but I am also keeping one eye on the PS3 but I am definitely going to buy a Revolution."
microsoft,sony,"wich is better, the Sony play station or the Microsoft XBOX?","For a wide selection, choose PS2. However, XBOX games tend to be of higher graphical quality and performance with minimal loading times in comparison to their counterparts or similar games on PS2. Also, the XBOX online service XBOX Live is far more immersive as a community and tends to lag far less than PS2 online games, since the service is a broadband only community with a full network of proprietary servers. I personally prefer XBOX for its 
superior selection of first person, racing, and online competetive games.

Examples:

FPS: Halo/Halo2, the Rainbow Six series, Half-Life 2

Racing: Project Gotham Racing 1&2, Forza Motorsport, Need for Speed Most Wanted

Online Competetive (also have decent single player experience): Conker: Live and Reloaded, Phantom Dust, most Electronic Arts or 2k/ESPN sports

*Most Wanted and Rainbow six have installments on both systems, but the XBOX versions perform better.","For a wide selection, choose PS2.

Based on the specs I've seen, PS3.","The revolution will win. Because it will have a game library with nes, snes, N64 games and posibly will have segas games too.  Also because of the controler, Sony and Microsoft are afraid of chainge while nintendo is not, with the controler you can shoot better,  slash better and many other things.","I think that Microsoft will win actually, The only good game i know of for PS3 is the new Metal Gear Solid, Xbox360 will have PDZ and Call of Duty, plus KOTOR 3, Jade Empire 2 and Fable 2.

I own a 360 and so far I'm not impressed.  If you love Racing, Sports and First Person shooters that look great get a 360 cause you'll love it.

You guys should cool down and live in the present and not in the future or past. Play the games infront of you now before dreaming of playing future games.

microsoft,sony,PS3 or X-BOX 360? We all know that these are the latest platforms by SONY and MICROSOFT. But which is better?,"I'm sure you knew when you posted this that we will not know untill the PS3 is out.
Sony will have to really throw some bombs at E3 this year, last years E3 left me a little disapointed.
This is what they have to say this year.

 ""We have always said that the PlayStation 3 will be playable at this year's E3 and that hasn't changed""
 ""We have a three platform showing this year and of course the PlayStation 2, which is now more popular than ever, will share space with the PSP and the PlayStation 3.""

Xbox 360 is a great console and with Xbox Live their is no way that the 360 will be Dreamcasted with their earley release.

So pretty much I think it all falls down to the on-line play.

A recent article from PSM confirms that Sony is really making a legitimate attempt at taking on Microsoft’s Xbox Live system.
PSM reports that you will be able to see recorded gameplay footage  which includes your achievements and in-game highlights  you will also be able to make your own video blog. This will be recorded with an Eye-Toy like device and can be shared with your friends. Your video blog will also likely support the PSP’s Eye-Toy function, allowing you to upload videos and pictures directly to your PS3.

So if this is true Xbox may have some serious competition.

Me pesonaly, I think the PS3 will be the best.

-------- Edit -----------

NinjaPirate, rumor had it that the PS3 would be arround 610 and 730 dollars.

Sony has now released a statement saying that it would be arround $500, and with the high-definition and Blu-ray disc functionality that would be a good price.

They jumped on this rumor fast so their may not be as much truth to it as we think.
That was a good point NinjaPirate.","I'm sure you knew when you posted this that we will not know untill the PS3 is out.

But i would prefer ps3 cause im a fan of sony.","the ps3 has a disk that hold 3 times more media than a dvd, but it will become obsoleate in about a year because dvds are soon to be even bigger than the ps3's disks oh and the ps3 will put a knotch in the disk you buy for it so you cant play it in other systems... those sick bastards....

microsoft,sony,Sony Ps3 vs Microsoft Xbox 360 vs Nintendo wii?,"No contest, the PS3 kicks the pants off of the other systems in almost every area, problem is the price kicks the pants off of the other systems too.  But it's a much better console if you can afford it.  The Blu-Ray disk player alone is worth $600, if you don't know what that is it's basically next generation DVD.  It also has a bigger hard drive than other stations and the online service is said to be as good if not better than X-box live and it's completely free.  The only real down side is that the disks are smaller storage size than X-box disks, but they can still hold an insane amount of gaming.  If you have the money for any system, you definetely want to get the PS3.  If you are a previous X-box owner on a more modest budget, go with the 360 so you can play old games and keep a little cash in your pocket.  If you don't want to spend much or want to try something new, go with the Wii, it's definetely unique.

Oh, by the way, this is a completely unbias opinion.  I'm not a PS3 fanboy, I'm actually looking at a Wii because they're cheaper.  I'm just laying out the facts and you can decide based on your budget.  A lot of the answers before me I've noticed are by obvious fanboys, like the guy who said he's giving away his PS3 because the 360's better.  That is a COMPLETE LIE, no one is dumb enough to spend $600 ona great station and then give it away because it's not as good as another, unless he's some kind of retard or like Bill Gates son.

(I own a wii and they rock!!),the ps3 has a good launch title. the game resistance:fall of man is one of the best games out there and the online play in unmatched in my openion.

They're slower than mice, and don't smell as much as rats, especially if you clean the cage every week.   Of course, there's a good bit to be aware of before getting any of these animals, if you really wish to take good care of the critter.  I'd recommend a site like http://www.hamsterhideout.com/allabthams.html if you're interested in getting a hammy.

Niether rarely bite and both can be trained to do tricks. If you need any more advice don't hesitate to email me. P.s Male rats are easier to handle than females as they are less active.

mouse,rat,What's the difference between a mouse and a rat?,"Holy crap -- what a bunch of wrong answers (so far)!

They are different animals within one category: Rodentia

Rats are bigger and have longer tails, although a baby rat will resemble a grown mouse.  Mice tails have fur, rats have scales.  Rats have longer teeth, but both must gnaw to keep their teeth worn down. Both can carry disease, but domesticated rodents -- especially rats -- make good pets.

Mice dribble urine quite a bit, so their cages will smell...but their feces are small and harden quickly (generally the size of a piece of rice cut in half).  Neither rodent stores food (the way gerbils and hamsters do), and surprisingly, rats can be taught to use a liter box.

None is better than the other.  For instance, an apple computer is great for graphic design, while a dell or ibm have features such as microsoft, etc.",The best computer is one which has the best processor.Best Processor equals best performance. Dell uses Intel process exclusively. IBM uses either Intel or AMD processors. Apple has its own processor.Neither Apple or AMD base their performance on old concept that the more Megahertz the processor had the better it was.  First Apple then AMD have proven that Megahertz alone is not a very good way to measure the computers performance.  Apple does not use the Windows operating system.  If you use to Windows then you will find Apple confusing.  It is my belief that the best computer is one which uses an AMD64 processor.  Recent reports are that the AMD is the number one desktop computer sold in the retail market for general home use.  And the best news is that a computer with an AMD processor is generally hundreds of dollars less expensive than one using Intel.  Performance testing in recent years have proved over and over that an AMD powered computer of say 2100 Megahurtz performs as well or in most cases better than an Intel powered computer operating at 3400 Megahertz.

Apples are very secure because they're such a small part of the computer market, no one is trying to break into them. They also seem a bit stabler because they control the hardware and software. They are also more expensive and have less software that works on them.

PCs are typically cheaper, and have lots of software (even freeware) that you can use on them. Unfortunately, the operating systems hold it back from being easy to use. Windows works great, but isn't very secure, so it makes the average user become a security guru. Linux is there, and is secure, but has almost no ""average joe"" support and isn't as easy to use if you want to do anything more than email and document creation.

From what I have read in Smart Computing Dell has about the worst tech support and computers ever. Though I can not recall all the stories or names of the people one story does stand out.  A woman bought a Dell laptop for about 900 and left it in her car one night. The computer froze and the screen cracked. Dell said that they would replace the screen for free. So she sent the computer off to Dell. Dell called back and told her that the computer would cost 960 dollars or so to fix. Not replace just fix the screen. The lady wrote Smart Computing and since they have more power than a regular person does and they cleared the issue up for the woman.  This is just one of the many Dell horror stories. Other stories include Dell promising to replace things with new parts only to put refurbished parts in the computer and then the parts burning out shortly after. Dell charging people for things they never bought or charging them for things that were covered under the warranty. The list goes on. Every month there is at least one letter of complaint about Dell in SC and they aren't the only company who consumers have problems with but they do seem to have the worst and most problems.  Personally I wouldn't go with any of the big name computer companies except for Apple. STOP! I know what you are thinking . 'I'm going to go buy an Apple.' Don't just yet. Apple makes a good solid computer BUT if you are not ready for a completely different operating system I do not recommend that you get an Apple. If I were out to buy a laptop I would find a friend who knows his or her computers and then have them help you through the part selection process over at http://www.ibuypower.com. They have a good selection of computers at a very nice price and do not practice those weird gimmicks that places like Dell do where they say you can get the computer for 'as low as xxx' but it turns out to be a good bit more than that because the base parts they use are sub-par technologies. But yeah that's just what I would do. The best thing is to read up on these companies and have that tech savvy friend help compare the 'bang for the buck' factor at all the different laptop manufacturers.,"If you plan to work on graphics software lie Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Corel Draw etc choose Mac systems. If you want to use a windows based operating sytstem use Toshiba. It guarantees best performance. HP laptops has Better graphics cards and good bundling and good pricing.

honda,toyota,Which is better? Honda CR-V or Toyota RAV4?,"If you're looking at 2005 models, get the CRV.  It is roomier and has a five speed automatic which improves performance and economy.  It also has standard side curtain airbags and stability + traction control.

In 2006, the RAV4 gets a significant upgrade.  The car is all new and signficantly nicer without a big increase in price.  The V6 model gets a monster 268 hp engine which makes the car as fast as many sports cars, while getting 28 mpg on the highway.  The 4 cylinder model remains a good value.  There is also a new option for a fold down third row seat, which is useful for children or short trips, and it closes the gap for safety features.  The RAV4 should range from 20-26K.  The 4 cylinder model should be hitting dealers now, whereas the V6 should be out in February.

Of course, this is only my opinion, you should test drive as much as you can before making a decision.","If you're looking at 2005 models, get the CRV.

Also, I would check the 3 year residual lease value for both.  The lease value is an estimate made by major banks about how the vehicle will hold its value.  Having your vehicle hold its value over the 3 or 4 years most people keep one is also a nice thing.  (Makes it easier to trade when you get ready too.)

In the end, I would drive both and try to figure out which I would enjoy most.

They think their V TEC is so great but everyone who tunes or works on the hondas, disables it. Why is that? The system is flawed, not at all a good design like ferrari and lamborghini has pulled off.

Honda's have a far superior engine in terms of power produced per cubic capacity whereas toyota's have better engine reliability(not that a Honda engine will fall of in 6 months, it will last for years), Honda's are a little more expensive to maintain but they have a much sportier image than the toyota. The main factor that makes me lean towards the Honda is that at high rpm the honda is a lot more stable, the steering wheel on toyotas is very light and this starts to shake vigourously when driving at high speed, can easily lead to loss of car control especially in extreme conditions."

They say as a rule of thumb (preventitive maintenance) to replace the water pump at 60,000mi. On the acura you can go to 90,000, of course I waited til my acura was at 120,000 and even then the shop that did it said everything looked really good for as many miles that it had at that time.","You cant really ask what car is better, like everything else it is really up to you...

honda,toyota,"What is the best car to by with high mileage, nissan, honda, toyota?","All three brands are excellent at high mileage. I've never owned a Toyota, but I have a friend who's put over 300k on his tercel. I've put 280k+ on two Nissan Maximas(84 and 94), and 250k+ on 2 Honda Civics (92 and 00). The Nissans did have some problems especially the '94. I had quite a few electrical problems with all the bell and whistles, power windows, and the transmission was finished when i got rid of it. The '84 lost power steering.  The Hondas had very minimal problems. I replaced a CV joint and a distributor on the '92, and nothing on the '00. So I guess I'd have to recommend a Honda overall because the are extremely reliable and sip gas.","All three brands are excellent at high mileage.

So ur best bet would be go for toyota,the hondas will last forever and you can aslways find them cheap,"Cars are built to run, not sit.  Most ANY high mileage car which has been maintained properly (this includes all fluids, hoses, tune ups etc.) is a better prospect than one with extreemly low miles which has not been cared for.

Those cars work, they look GREAT, and are good for our environment. As soon as i can drive, im getting a toyota.",A Toyota would last 20 years.  A Honda would last 15 years.  Toyotas use less gas which is good for the world and good for your wallet.  :) saves you money. I really recommend the Toyota Prius as it is a hybrid car.

The car runs with both gasoline and battery which is very amazing. you don't have to tune up in Toyota.  It is not necessary.,"Toyota- Honda's feel tinny.

They last forever. My first car was a 91 Celica & even way over 100,000 miles, it only needed regular maintenance. WHatever you choose, just keep up with oil changes & maintenance.

Its strange but they both make equally good cars as all of the other Japanese brands, Subaru, Nissan e.t.c.",Toyota,"Honda is the way to go for best overall product for buck. The Accord has been in Car and Driver's 10Best car list forever. The Civic continues to rack up awards for the new redesigned model.

Please aggrandize it!","its really personal prefence.  if you plan on driving it a little hard and would take a curvy road over the highway, the accord is better.  but if all you need is to get from point a to point b with as much comfort as possible, the camry is better.","I will choose Toyota Camry. I don't have Toyota Camry but I know some of my friends use that both car. By looking into the interior of inside the car, the elegance of the car, the comfortable of Toyota Camry..I will suggest you to choose that car.","adding Nissan Maxima to the list, here is the final verdict 'If you are a conservative driver take the Camry. It you like to lead life in the fast lane go for the Maxima. And, if you are somewhere in the middle, the Accord may be your choice.

It has 200hp and is available with a six speed transmission. It is available with navigation as well and i would suggest it because it really ties the whole interior together.

I just bought a Toyota and I really like it so far, and everyone I have talked to about it has told me stories of how they have had toyotas that have lasted forever.","You can do a Side by side Comparison with the J D Powers Web site-  I wanted to buy an American car,  so I did a Side by side with Camry, Accord,  Impala, Lasabre,   - Accord was ranked best-  and Camry, just one point or so over the Impala- and equal on the Lasabre,  I bought the Impala, 2005, 18k miles,  $13,000-   a 2005,  Accord or Camry would have cost, $18 to 20k   about one year ago. If you could find one.    You must weigh all the cost when shopping for a car-  sure we know Jap cars are a little better, but you also pay one hell of a lot more for them, and if you do need repairs,  it cost almost double for the work-   Buy a good American car-    I love my Impala- 28 mpg,  no problems- roomy, good ride, forerunner was the Lumina,  a car known to last if maintaind, for 200,000 miles -","Toyota and Honda are pretty close with great reliabiltly, with Nissan coming in a little behind in a recent nationwide study held in the US.

honda,toyota,"Which SUV is better, the Honda Pilot or the Toyota Hylander?","My family bought a '06 Pilot in March. We first looked at a Highlander, but we decided against the Highlander for these reasons:

1) Toyota's pricing was confusing. They quote you a ""base"" price and every upgrade is extra. Some saftey features (side air bags) were also optional.

2) The Pilot seemed roomier inside and all saftey equipment was standard.

3) The Pilot was $3000 cheaper than the Highlander.

With gas over $2.75/gallon, the Pilot is tough on the wallet, but I doubt the Highlander is much better.",THEY'RE VERY SIMILAR VEHICLES WITH DIFFERENT CHARACTERISTICS. THE PILOT IS A BIT SPORTIER WHILE THE HIGHLANDER IS MEANT MORE AS A CAR.,"I think the Pilot is better, Honda has a reputation as a very reliable make. Also, Hondas have better resale value.

My Toyota was very simple in technology and has greater tolerance. Can take you far. My Honda, good drive but fragile.

In terms of mpg and price, a Corolla and Civic will be comparable ($14K - $20K, depending on options and roughly 30ish mpg), although I don't know if those are the particular models you're looking at.  Both have very reliable motors that will last you over 200,000 miles if you do a decent job with the upkeep.  In terms of 'cool' factor, the styling is a subjective thing, but I can tell you that Hondas are much easier to perform aftermarket modifications on because a greater number of parts are more readily available.  Hope this helps. Edit: For the record, I happen to drive a 1999 Toyota Corolla that has nearly 150,000 miles on it now and it's still running strong.

And the Camry to the Accord.    They are all boring, very competent, exceedingly reliably and easy to insure cars.  The Toyotas a bit more reliable (someone is still driving my last Corolla around with 311,000 miles on it), Honda a bit less boring.  But which model and what paint color makes more difference. If cost is an issue, consider the Scion Xa which is made by Toyota but fully optioned and priced for the entry level buyer.  Like $13,000.  Or if you need volume, the Scion Xb is huge on the inside (but looks like someone pushed over a phone booth and attached four tires). Every 250,000 miles, I get a new Corolla.

The Corolla is a smaller,cheaper vehicle.","I think the Corolla gets better gas mileage, but the Civic is better than both.","well they are kind of different honda accord is more of a sedan based vehicle (directed for older people in their 30s and higher for family use). If you want a Honda that is similar to a Corolla I suggest a Civic. A Corolla is more economical than the accord is gas mileage (MPG are city 30 / hwy 38 for automatic and 32 / 41 for manual) there is less room for passengers in the back and has a more sporty american touch which means u can feel the road while driving. An Accord tends to be bought for ride comfort and long trips, which means it has a smoother suspension. BUt if you really want a bang for your money with money in your pocket. My parents bought a Ford Fiver Hunred for less than the money for a Corolla or Accord. It rides better than an Accord. Passenger room in the back can fit 3 grown people comfortably with more leg room in the back than in the front. They have an option where the back seats also recline. The two captain seats in front are elevated for better road handling. Has the best crash star rating which means you save on insurance costs as well. and has room for the whole PGA Tour's golf clubs. I have driven the Corolla, Civic (older version), Accord, and Ford Five Hundred and i would pick easily the Ford Fiver HUndred not because I like American cars more but the value of the vehicle. Road handling is very important and the view from all angles. Corolla's view is awful trying to reverse with a smal window which is similar to the Ford Fusion. Also Accord has troubling blind spots but handles well. But if you're going with looks i would say the Accord has the best out of all of them. And if you want something similar to an Accord that is stylish I do enjoy the Camry's new look from Toyota, but never drove it.","The Corolla is a fine built car since the early 80's. books and movies have been made telling about them. Since the Corolla is smaller it corners and handles better then the Accord. My astronomy teacher has a 95 Corolla and loves it more then life its self and i have raced it..... with my 93 Honda Accord and with her 115 horse power is spanked my 135 horse power Accord!!! i blasted away on the straight away but on those corners she passed me! The Honda Accord is the most reliable car there is because of the honor and work they put into the Honda and every other product they make. but there is always those few that slip through that are bad and will defect on you. after owning 13 different American cars and they all failed i cant trust Ford, Dodge or Chevy. this little Accord has 201,783 miles on it and just wont quit! as long as oyu change the oil, get the timing belts and hoses changed when your supposed to then your car will last forever. i used to have a 86 Honda Accord and it never had a problem, we gave it away to a paster with 340,000 miles. i ahve had really good days with the Accord's and i have read so many good things about the Corolla, i would choose a Corolla over an Accord. BUt the final choice is up to you, good luck!","The Corolla is a compact car, and the Accord is a mid size car.  I would agree that a Corolla is better than a Accord on these points:  Corolla is smaller, better gas mileage, and is to target a younger crowd. The real question is 'Is the 2007 Toyota Camry better than the 2006 Honda Accord?",they both suck...,"i think the Accord looks better, but the Corolla  is more reliable","the toyota is much more reliable,economically sensible,and more fun to drive jettas blow them both away",only if'n you own one,there the same. get a jetta,I love my 2005 Toyota Corrolla!,I have both cars.  They are both reliable and get great gas mileage.  I don't think one is better than the other.,"why get a TOYota, if you must have an ota get a Real Ota. Get the Honda instead - it has a better, proven record  - and the parent company is more stable.","There are a lot of differences between the two as Accord would be considered a sedan while Corolla is more of a compact.  They are both incredibly durable, Accord will have more space and performance, while Corolla will get better gas mileage and be a lot cheaper >$5000."

Consequently, it ferments over time, giving it a mildly alcoholic kick.

To an RPG gamer you might find the networking to be an extra bonus, being able to communicate with other PSP owners during a game a plus. The DS has this also, but the graphics on a DS are infantile in comparison. I suggest you read the G4 article on PSP/DS comparison. It does a great job of breaking down the 2 systems.

Gamers should stick to the ds (it even has online play!), but if you got the $350 to burn and you want something more than gaming then buy the psp.

The DS has better graphics, can run DS as well as GBA media, also has wireless built in, but can't access the web in general...only play certain games against others. It is also bigger then the psp, if you like that idea.  The PSP is not only a portable gaming system, it has a webbrowser built into it, which you can use for general 'net access (might have to hack a bit). PSP only media (runs UMD) you can watch movies in UMD format on this. It also features a memory card slot for save games, and mp3s (yes it also is a media player...only for mp3 though). In my personal opinion...its all down to choice, if you want a dedicated gaming system, and abailities to play someone across the country at mario cart, get a DS. If you want an mp3 player, web browser, movie player, and a game system all rolled into one, get a PSP. If you want cheap, get a DS (159.99 abouts, brand new...seen them about 100.00 used) If you don't mind price, get a PSP its about 250.00 (seen one for about 199.99 used)  Also, depends on what your gaming likings are....I've seen games for both PSP and DS that I like.","the psp it has more to offer, or to do","PSP. It can store photos, play music and movies, and, of course, you can play video games! Who needs a touch screen? It's original, but boring.",ofcourse psp it's the stupidest question i've ever seen u should know psp is much better than nintendo playstation always has been better than nintendo,"PSP, definitely. For one, the screen. It is a 4.3 inch LCD screen. It has great color, so you can put lots of pictures, TV shows, movies, or whatever you want on it to watch. It has some good games too. You can take it wherever you want, and play whenever you are on long trips or even when you are on the bus to school or to work. Plus, it's still fun to just chill with at home. You can rent or buy UMD discs, which are pretty much the PSP's version of the DVD. There is a huge selection, which is constantly growing. You can save pictures on it, and music too. Plus, there are some user-made games such as Pac-Man you can get online for free. The only downside is price. $250, plus tax. If you want to save pics and music, you'll need a memory chip, which costs more. Overall though, it's a pretty nice, nifty little thing. The DS has a touch screen, but lacks many of the PSP's key features like movies, music, and pics. Although the DS is only about $150, the PSP is worth the extra money.","I own both the psp and the ds. It all depends on what you prefer. if you like action and shooter games, web browsing, music, and movies the psp is for you. If you like mario, rpg's, adventure games, then the ds. the psp is easily breakable and the ds is indestructable. but you can buy a great case for $20. I would recomend the psp.","the DS because the dual screen/touch screen allows so much more room for potential inventiveness in games. I guess i have to agree in that it does matter in what you are looking for. For the gaming purists, i'd advise getting a DS because the 'quirkiness' of the touch screen will lead to the release of many new and inventive games.

Do you want to play your PSP instead of a console, or are you buying just for on the road type situations. Aside from a few great games, the best thing about the PSP that I have found is being able to play classic Nintendo games on it, through downloads. The DS can't play movies, music, or show picutes. It doesn't have nearly as a good of an online system or a web browser, but the games on it really are awsome. A choice list of games that make buying one worthwhile are: Mario Kart DS, Animal Crossing: Wild World, Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow, and Trama Center: Under the Knife.

The DS specializes in unique gameplay by using the touch screen and sometime voice capabilities in games such as Nintendogs which I don't even consider to be a game. The PSP beats the DS graphically wise but it depends on what kinds of games you like, the DS has lots of RPGs and cartoony type games but it is targeted at a younger audience.  The PSP has first person shooters and Grand Theft Auto on it with much better graphics and a more serious nature.  There is also SOCOM on the PSP now which I believe includes voice functions as well much like the PS2 version of the game. I don't consider the DS superior capability wise but it does have innovation on its side.  But, if you are looking at pure capabilities and specs, the PSP puts the DS out to pasture.  But the two devices are not directly competing with each other so they are hard to compare but people who are saying the DS is better probably like the games on it better than the PSP but the PSP is superior spec wise.",HELL YES DUDE HOW CAN YOU NOT KNOW THAT,The compromise is as such: Better overall unit (PSP) vs. More reliable unit (DS)

ds,psp,"What's the differerance between PSP, Nitendo DS, GameBoy Advance SP?","The PSP is an all around media device that can be used as an player for mp3's and even movie files.  It uses a  proprietary media formats like the Sony Memory Stick for saving data and transferring media between your computer and PSP, and the UMD (Universal Media Disc, think a small DVD in a cartridge) for games and near-DVD quality movies.  It has a wide screen, comes in sleek black, and controls with 2 shoulder buttons, a D-pad, four action buttons, and a commonly hated upon analog nub.  Great looking 3D game play in your pocket, if you like ports and weak sequels of PS2 favorites.

The Nintendo DS is different.  It can connect wirelessly (in person or across the internet) for multiplayer game play, just like the PSP.  Its most striking feature are the system's 2 screens, the bottom screen doubling as a touch screen, similar to touch sensitive screens found on Pocket PCs.  The DS cannot be used as an all encompassing media device like the PSP, but critically (critically, not by sales) it has become a device for playing creative, interactive, and just plain different types of games like the recently released Electroplankton, Animal Crossing DS, and Phoenix Wright: Attorney at Law.  It can control with the familiar D-pad, 2 shoulder, and 4 action buttons, but it can also utilize the built in microphone for voice commands and a palm pilot inspired stylus for use on the touch screen.  It can also play Game Boy Advance games.

The Game Boy Advance was the first back-lit portable handheld for Nintendo, and departed from the Game Boy Advance's ""wide"" design for a clam-shell (which is also what the DS is).  There were a couple of Pokemon games released that connect wirelessly for poke battles, but other than the ability to play both Gameboy Advance games and Gameboy games, it has a library of hundreds, perhaps thousands of games.  However, you'll actually only want to play about 1% of those games.  Both systems are plagued by untold numbers of licensed kiddie schlock that isn't worth the it gets tossed into a year after release, let alone the 30 bucks it would cost to get it new.

In short:
PSP - $250 - Lots of media features and my favorite PS2 franchises on the go.
Nintendo DS - $130 - Nothing but games here, the old favorites from the Gameboy Advance and some quirky, interesting, and fun new things.
Gameboy Advance SP - $80 - A styling Gameboy Advance.  That is back lit.

However, if you're looking solely on internals, the PSP is better.","Well, I have a DS, and like everyone, have played a PSP as well.  Personally, I like Nintendo's games better than that of Sony.

You can play emulated SNES, NES, NEO GEO, MAME arcade, etc games. You can remote access your computer with it. And a whole slew of other things. Plus, the DS feels much more bulky. But the DS does have many fun games. Let's keep our fingers crossed for this year's PSP releases.",PSP,"psp by far! i mean, playstation doesn't have the best games, but a psp has more features!",P--------S---------P,DS,ds is WAY better!!! i have one. it is so awsome!!! besides PSP doesnt have long battery life. id have to go with nds
ds,psp,"Which one of these game consoles should I be better off buying, a Sony PSP or Nintendo DS?","The DS has better gaming capabilities. The PSP has straight forward games, big whoop. You can watch movies on the PSP, but they cost the same, or sometimes more than the movie on regular dvd.

The DS would be the way to go. It's more than just button mashing. Open possibilities for programmers.","The DS has better gaming capabilities. The PSP has straight forward games, big whoop.

ds,psp,PSP vs DS?,"Here's some hardcore facts:
I own both PSP and DS (as well as just about all other systems and consoles.)

PSP
Pros:
-Connectable to PCs via USB cables so you can upload videos, games, hacks, cracks, music, plus updates and misc. stuff that you'd want, and can act as a portable hard drive too.
-With the latest updates for the PSP you can browse the internet via WI-FI enabled hot spots or a wireless router.
-PSP also has many movies you can buy on UMDs.

Cons:
-Memory cards can be very bothersome in cost. A 1GB card costs and extra $100. Also the defalt 32M memory card is rather small for music or updates (if you try to get the updates for Wipout Pure your stuck in the mud as you can barely fit 3 out of the current 7 updates on the memory card).
-Battery life currently is very short (7 and 1/2 hours if you’re lucky, usually 5 or 4)
-Very few games as of yet have very little support for the internet features offered for the PSP.

DS:
Pros:
-Touch screen is very innovative and offers a much broader area for future game development. Currently (there are some, but in my opinion) not many games that really use this feature well.
-Two screens is also an interesting step for gaming.
Games (from exp.) very rarely crash and don't have as many graphics glitches as some games are (GTA:LCS) for the PSP.
-Battery life usually lasts for about 6-12 hours.

Cons:
-In comparison with PSP the graphics detail is split between the two screens.
-No internet browser what so ever.
-Not many games (so far) use the WI-FI internet connectivity.

Personally I'd say the PSP is more customizable, but is really only worth the price ($250) if you have your own computer. Half the features require a computer connection.
The DS is more family orientated as there aren't as many M or T rated games as the PSP. Also the price of $150 is more affordable.
Both systems, when using any kind of wireless communication (local or internet) lowers battery life by a very large amount (about 1/2 normal life for both).

Many people have asked me this so I'll post it here, PSP can't, can't, can't, play DVDs!","Here's some hardcore facts: I own both PSP and DS (as well as just about all other systems and consoles.)

It's so awsm","i would go with PSP. but it matters alot on the age of the person who plays it. if your older and like to listen to music and watch videos as well as playing more mature games the PSP is the way to go. If your more into the mario and those sorts of game the DS might be the way to go. All in all i would go with the PSP because you can serf the web, play with freinds on dif psps, videos, pics, songs.

a.like two screens
b.like nintendo games
c.like to use a stylist to draw and do stuff
Also the graphics sometimes reminds me of the N64 and the gameboy advance. I have all so heard that the PSP will be able to hook up to the PS3 like the Game cube and Gameboy advance.

Right now, both libraries are kinda week, but if you really wanna play the new Castlevania, or Super Mario Bros., it's gotta be DS.  If you wanna play Liberty City Stories, it's gotta be PSP.

If you like car games I would recommend Burnout Legends...fantastic.,PSP cause of the features,go for the psp.i have a ds and it is not worth it atm but maybe when it has more games that will change.,psp way better graphics than a stupid gameboy and on psp u can go on the internet and watch movies its great and its small anoth to carry round with u,"I have a PSP and I bought MVP baseball for it.  The graphics are nice, but the game takes a VERY long time to load.  I am considering selling the PSP to get a DS.  I play my GBA SP much more than I do my PSP because I don't have to wait so long for the games to load, and I seldomly ever have more than 5 or 10 minutes to play at a time.  The PSP eats all my time up trying to load the game."
ds,psp,Which one? Sony PSP or Nintendo DS?,"It all depends on what you are looking for. I have had experience with both and I would have to say neither. If you are wanting to get a handheld system save you money. Within a few months Nintendo is going to release what is called the Nintendo DS Lite in America. It is the same as the Nintendo DS except it is more compact, has better button placement, and the screens are brighter and sharper (same size screens but smaller unit).
At first glance the Sony PSP is better because it is basically a PS2. But there are some things to think about. First off the PSP has fallen short as far as game variety goes. I knows people who have sold theirs because they just don't have that good of a game variety. Another thing is that the black glossy finish on the PSP looks horrible in any sort of light. It picks up fingerprints and oil from your hands horribly. Also its easier to see scratches and such. As far as the harddrive goes, it is rather small and a waste. You may say that its not a problem because it supports memory cards, well memory cards are expensive. Not to mention that the PSP is fairly large...

Ok, about the DS. The current DS is built like a tank. I don't like its design and I don't find it portable. The screens are a little dull in the light also. But this is a Nintendo product so it will be innovative, right? Right. DS means that it has Dual Screens, one regular screen on the top and one touch screen on the bottom. This really rocks because you can control your character and do many things with a touch screen. There are quite a few good games for the DS too and the DS plays Game Boy Advance games. Metroid Hunters is a good action game and it is playable online too. Thats another thing, the DS has built in WI-FI so all you need to do is be at a HotSpot (Mcdonalds have these) or by a wireless network. If you don't have a wireless network in your house you can buy a small adaptor that plugs into any standard USB and sends out a wireless network. But as I said earlier, the DS Lite will be the way to go. So here's the rundown:

1st Place: Nintendo DS Lite
2nd Place: Nintendo DS
3rd Place: Sony PSP

`Side Note`
To everyone out there who just thinks I'm a Nintendo fanboy, well I'm not. I have systems from all three of the major video game companies.","It all depends on what you are looking for.

PSP just keep importing old stuff from PS1..",I would choose Nintendo DS even the PSP seems to have so much better feature. I would of like the PSP if they didn't use external memory card with max 2GB or less for each card. It would be awesome if it was a intenal 30GB or more.

Be a man.,having played both before i made the purchase i would say the psp. ds are good fun mario kart is a winner and the entire back catalouge of gb advance games cannot be laughed off. i didnt like the feel of the machine i found the ds suprisingly plastic which made it feel like it was cheap materials the touch screen was annoying and a lack of analouge stick made game play thumb numbing.  the ds is able to handle 3d graphics despite wht your first answerer thinks see mario kart and mario and goldeneye:rogue agent.  psp fantaastic graphics fanstic sound movie catalouge game catalouge solid and sturdy. get a psp,PSP Because it has 3D Graphics unlike Nintendo DS.,PSP if you like 'grown-up' games.

ds,psp,"what is a better console a PSP, nintendo ds, or a GBA?","For starters, throw away the idea of a GBA.  Trust me you don't need it anymore.  So, its down to PSP and DS.  Personally I choose the DS.  At first the PSP does look better but its all about what you're into.  The DS touch screen makes it easy to take PC games and develop them into DS games.  PSP has insane loading times whereas DS has next to none.  DS is lighter making it the better handheld.

By the way, sounds like Microsoft may have their own handheld soon, the Origami, check the link below","For starters, throw away the idea of a GBA.  Trust me you don't need it anymore.

Thus far, DS has been a flop. The whole stylus idea is not a very good one, and the WiFi connections are pretty lame.

And $39.99-$49.99 And Higher Game Pricetags, And Other More Expensive Accessories Needed/Opted To Get The Best Out Of It.. And From All These, It's Up To You, The Consumer, On Which Is Best..

ds,psp,which is better the DS Nintendo or the PSP????,PSP!! for sure!,PSP!! for sure!,I read to many 'DS=Good PSP=bad' reviews to say the PSP is better so DS all the way!,"The Nintendo DS has games you can't play anywhere else, I love my PSP but its just a portable PS2, I would go for the DS.  Tetris DS!",PSP because it's a lot sleeker and thinner. And you can watch movies on it! Multimedia bliss... DS was a bit of a disappointment because it ended up looking very bulky. Its only redemption is its neato stylus and awesome games you expect from Nintendo XD,"PSP - Great graphics, has tons of additional multimedia features, plus cool franchise games. DS - Franchise games too, but the best selling point of this is its innovations on mobile gaming like voice recognition, motion-detection, and a touch pad which all in all let you do a lot of fun and intersting things. Pick whichever you think is more important.","if you're buying for you're son and you want to make him really, really, really, really, happy, get the pSp man!

Go for the touch screen!!!  10 hours of battery life and PSP gets 3 hours. Also the Nintendo DS is backwards compatable. It's also more durable, I have dropped that thing i can't even tell you how many times, but the first time I dropped the PSP, It broke and now it won't run off of the battery anymore! DS comes in more colors, it's cheaper (they just dropped the price) and they have games of all kinds. You can also connect to the Nintendo internet if you have a wireless router and for some games, you can play anyone anywhere. (like mario kart). Also, some cartoons put episodes on GameBoy Advance cartriges and since the DS is backwards compatable, you can buy those and watch them on the DS. And they are cheaper than the PSP games as well.","Nintendo DS, all the way.","PSP sucks... plain and simple.... too expensive.. memory sticks are godly over priced, games arent that great and they're lack of innovation is what makes PSP such a failure in my eyes... just look at the DS, it has INNOVATIVE written all over it whether it be the touch screen which has added a great deal of immersion into the games, or the built in microphone which allows you to communicate with your game, or even the built in pictochat program which is, in my opinion, a monumental step in handheld gaming.... I gotta say though, the reason why the DS takes the cake is simply the NINTENDO WIFI CONNECTION... what more could we ask for than handheld multiplayer made as simple as sitting down, switching it on, and connecting to a wifi router... DS IS THE WINNER PLAIN AND SIMPLE.... FAIR AND SQUARE... so SONY you can take your little wanna be IPOD/PS2 portable crossover and stick it where the sun dont shine",Don't listen to those Sony fanboys! The DS is NOT kiddy!

Great for multiplayer play  Will soon have web-browsing and tv on it... Weakness: It is a bit fat looking for the old one.  The GBA slot is it's main weakness as dust can easily get in there.   PSP Strengths: Good graphics, impressive slew of video games, has a decent multimedia support, Wi-Fi support, very slick and thin. Weakness: While the multimedia is ok, it still needs work.  You need your own software and memory sticks to store your videos, music, and photos.  The UMD disc also has a very long load time for it. Battery life is also not as fantastic. The PSP is more of the do it all machine.

Nintendo DS, while can play second generation and has a nifty stylus, does lack the ability to play movies or music. The PSP can play games, but also has a large extensive library of movies that you can play. Also more third party companies make accessories for the PSP, so they are cheaper and more readily available. However, there could be things to influence your decision... for instance if you have some Gameboy games from a SP, you may want to buy a Gameboy DS.",psp is the best so far..but games for the rest may pass it up one day,"Thats pretty much a no brainer.

The PSP has LOTS of uses when combined with a memory stick (like my 2gb), but the PSP is very much lacking in the game department right now.  Also, the UMD thing is rather stupid.

Nintendo also invented a great platformer (mario) and other uniqe features like the light gun, so before you flame nintendo, think what they have done for other companies to proceed","PLEASE READ THIS!!! Nintendo DS is the better gaming portable. Why? Because the games are creative and are not ports of existing console games. The touchpad, microphone, and accessible Wi-Fi make it better for gaming. The PSP's games are usually stripped down versions of console games. Not only that, the unique games still aren't that good because they try to beat consoles in gameplay, graphics, and loading, but they obviously can't. Also the DS Lite is coming out; it is smaller, lighter, has adjustable brightness, better button layout than the original, and only costs $129.99 while the PSP core system costs $199.99! The PSP core system also doesn't include a memory stick, which happens to cost a lot. Finally, the DS's games are usually around $29.99 to $34.99 while PSP games cost $39.99 and up. p.s. super dude who posts under me somewhere, I checked you stupid idiot, the PSP that comes with a memory stick is $250, not $200.

When was the last time you stared at a picture and was amused.  The DS is still a gaming system with all of the great games (Castlevania, Sonic, Mario Bros.)

Now...to answer the question (again). It would depend on your preferences...

If you like to play straight games...DS (and new DS Lite).

If you like to play games with better graphics, listen to music on the go, watch movies on a break, check your e*mail when you're out with friends at the mall, read mini-magazines on that bus ride home, watch TV with LocationFree(r), listen to the latest radio shows using RSS...PSP.

But then again...it's all on you.

*~*~*~*

Heheh...totally forgot the other part...ummm...

PS3...only because I've given my first child to Sony along with an arm and a leg to stay faithful :p","I tend to have a slight bias towards Nintendo, so I'll say that the 360 and DS are the best.  The 360 has awesome games, and the graphics match those of the PS3. Developers have said time after time that the difference between the PS3 and 360 are so minor, that no one will be able to notice them. Since I'm not interested in playing Blu-Ray movies, and since I'm interested in the games that the 360 has, I'd get the 360. And even if you don't like the games right now, the 360 will have more games than the PS3 and Wii combined for probably a year (I said combined, it will always have more games than either of the two, or at least the PS3 because it's so hard to dev for), and that means more variety. The DS, is a handheld gaming system. I have a PSP, and I must say, it feels more than a console than a handheld. You might think that's a good thing, but it's not if you want a PORTABLE. With the DS, there are games where you can just pick up and play, AND games that you can play for a long time. I have a PSP, so I know what the games feel like. Since I'm not interested in sports games because you've played on (in a certain sport), you've played them all, I have other games. There are a few exceptions though, like Daxter. Daxter is a nice little platformer that you can play anytime you want, while Metal Gear Acid doesn't allow saves until you beat an hour long mission. Now, the PSP's advantage, special features. Let's start first with web browsing. What a useless feature! It takes forever to type in what you want, and then when you get to a page, it appears all messed up because of the size of the PSP screen. The DS web browser, which comes out next month in Japan, from what I have seen, is a breeze. When you want to type an adress, you use the bottom screen to type in letters by touching, which is much easier. While browsing, the bottom screen provides a overview of the page, and the top screen provides a close up of the space the browser is centered on. It's much easier to use. Music and movies, since I don't have a music player, this might be useful to me. But then, I can just go to the store and buy a 1 gig MP3 player for $30-$50. I don't see music and movies as something very important, but it's up to you. Graphics, the PSP graphics are stunning. The PSP is great at displaying 3D images, and is near PS2 quality. The DS on the other hand is slightly better than the N64. I'd say a bit below DreamCast level. The DS has great games to make up for the step ahead the PSP is in graphics though. The PSP has mostly multiplatform titles and ports of PS2 games though, and some PSP exclusive games are no longer exclusive. GTA: Liberty City Stories is an example, a PS2 version ships two weeks from now. Well, that's my opinion, I'm trying to be as unbiased as possible. I don't own any next generation consoles, or Xbox 360, since that's the only next-gen console that's out, but I do have both handhelds.","ds- it is more innovative, and for proof it is killing psp i sales you cant judge between the last three. all will be great as far as graphics but i'm getting a revolution(aka Wii) because it offers a more immersive experience.","DS just rocks.

I prefer the DS Lite as it is more aesthetically beautiful then the Sony PSP.  The glossiness of it makes it very attractive and it's screen is superb and could pump up twice as many lumens as the Sony PSP screen i believe. the battery life is also incredible.
Nintendo games advantages for the DS is that there is little loading time, the max being only a couple second compared to the up to 30 second loading time for the psp.  Also, future upgrades for the DS will allow you to surf the web on it and  watch tv on it, live streaming.
The cartridge system also works very well for the DS, not to mention it has many popular games.  Final Fantasy 3 is scheduled to launch for the DS real soon.
The Nintendo DS also features a ""Picto-CHat"" allowing you to chat with other people by infrared communications i believe.  Also, you can ""DS Download Play"" allowing you to ""download a sliver of a game"" from your buddies so you can always play multiplayer.
The DS is much cheaper, and doesn't scratch as easily thanks to it's protective folding.  Also, the microphone in the DS allows you to talk in some games.

Why, PSP has no games of it's own? I'm sure you really enjoy illegally emulating games. If you had a DS, then you'd be playing new, fresh games, not old games, or PS2 ports.

""Well, I personally think the touch screen is just stupid.""
Have you tried any games that use the feature well? I think you've never touched a DS in your life. Go play Metroid Prime Hunters, it makes a great use of the touch screen, it uses it to make a FPS game possible on the DS. And the touch screen is not the only feature, there is the microphone too. The microphone is used for voice chat with friends on Metroid Prime Hunters, and many other things in Nintendogs.

""The PSP costs more, but it has better hardware and you can also surf the web, listen to music, and watch videos in addition to playing games. The DS is cheaper, but from what I have heard, the games are better.""
Exactly, you're paying an extra $80-$100 for extra junk. And you can have those features on the DS too. There is a web browser coming out in Japan next month (probably comes out a month or two later) for $30, and there are already some third party media players, like the GBA Movie Player from lik-sang.com, it plays movies and music like the PSP, and it can be used on the GBA SP, plus it only costs $25, and uses either compact flash or SD cards. DS Lite + Web Browser + GBA MP = $180, $20 cheaper than PSP, and has all the extra junk. Plus when the DS Lite comes out in the US (June 11th), most likely there will be an original DS price drop. If the price drops, then you save even more money, and you get great games to play too.

Every platform, except maybe GBA, has Need for Speed. The PSP just has a graphically suprerior one. Besides, what's so good about Need for Speed? Just the same rehashed gameplay (drive cars, blah blah) used over and over again with few differences. Metroid Prime Hunters sold much better than NFS, because it was new.

PSP more ports of PS2 games, while the DS only has 2 ports, Super Mario 64 DS and Resident Evil: Deadly Silence. The easiest way is to do real research instead of claiming crap without proof.

Nintendo originally planned to release the adaptor in the U.S. by the end of 2005, but it appears their plans have changed, as Nintendo has not delivered an announcement of a U.S. release with specific dates as of April 2006.' There is also another media player for half that price called the GBA Movie Player. You can import it from lik-sang. That takes care of music and movies on memory sticks. 'Web Browser On February 15, 2006, Nintendo announced a version of Opera, a cross-platform web browser which will take advantage of the dual screens for either zooming in on certain sections of a website or having a longer vertical view. Opera for the DS will have an upgradeable firmware, which will enable software updates. The browser will go on sale in Japan on June 2006, for 3,800 yen. ($32.15 USD). So far, no U.S. or European release has been mentioned[15][16], but screens of an English version and promotional material have been released at E3.' Import it if you want internet. It costs $30 and comes out next month. Takes care of the internet doesn't it? And we all know how successful UMD movies are *cough*failure*cough*. 'In my opinion it is the PSP for sure!

In Japan alone the sales of the DS are 2-3 times that of the PSP.  Now, regarding the titles available : The gaming market in Asia is the biggest in the world by far.

I played my first game...and was bored with it by the second day. 

So I tryed renting more PSP games to find my forte....I came up with nothing. Mean while, the DS was starting to pick up some games that sparked my interest. There was Animal Crossing DS (great game), Nintendogs, Mario Kart, Electroplankton, Metroid Prime Hunters, Super Princess Peach, Resident Evil, Lost in Blue, and MORE!

I had a hard time trying to figure out which games to buy...and how to get enough money for them! And although the games did not have the very best of graphics, they do have what the PSP games didn't; Structure.

That upcoming October I decided to try out the PSP...It looked perfect! Great graphics, awesome features, and you could even play movies on it. I got my PSP and happily took it home. I played my first game...and was bored with it by the second day.  So I tryed renting more PSP games to find my forte....I came up with nothing. Mean while, the DS was starting to pick up some games that sparked my interest. There was Animal Crossing DS (great game), Nintendogs, Mario Kart, Electroplankton, Metroid Prime Hunters, Super Princess Peach, Resident Evil, Lost in Blue, and MORE! I had a hard time trying to figure out which games to buy...and how to get enough money for them! And although the games did not have the very best of graphics, they do have what the PSP games didn't; Structure.  The DS games are fun...although some are flops, most are super-entertaining.  My PSP? I sold it on eBay and got a DS Lite. So my advice, get the DS!","The psp is much better, and u can do much more on it :Internet :Movies :Music UMD's :Wireless :Mp3 player :MP4 Player :Games etc",PSP.IS HAS BEEN HACKED AND CAN DO LIKE 20+ THINGS THAN THE DS.ON THE PSP U CAN EVEN CONTROL UR COMPUTER(WIFI CONNECTINON).SO IF U WANT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THIS HACKING STUFF ON THE PSP E-MAIL ME AT MARTINEZLUISDANIEL@YAHOO.COM AND PLZ VISIT PSP-HACKS.COM FOR GREAT PSP HACKING AND MORE EXPERINCE,DS is for fun and interactive games while PSP is for serious players with decent graphics.,"according to G4 tv, (formerly tech tv) the psp has better graphics. I would go with the psp.",buy the DS because it is so much better than the psp. the psp is worthless because there are no good games except Killzone Liberation. the DS has a better view of games and graphics dont matter as much as gameplay,The DS because the DS's games are funner.,A PSP is because on a PSP you can download pictures and songs and it has better graphics than a DS and on a PSP you can get on the internet .,"DS for great games, gameplay and fun, PSP for entertainment and power but very poor software.","The DS.  Because it has a touch screen and it has a lot of games including: New Super Mario Bros, Metroid Prime Hunters, The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass (Coming soon), and a lot more.","There are lots of person there and there are thousand of reason they can give you. So to help you, I'll give you no reason but facts instead. First, DS sales is better than PSP. That, of course has its own reason. Nintendo do better at handheld war than Sony, cause Nintendo has lots of experience from GameBoy series). Second, DS is cheaper than PSP. Third, PSP hardware is way better than DS, but DS gives you two screens, stylus, and built-in microphone, and don't forget that DS's able to play GBA games. Basically, buying PSP is like having a miniature version of your PS2. While buying DS is like buying a completely new handheld console that give you different kind of handheld gaming experience (plus playing GBA games as a bonus) So, the conclusion is PSP is good for one that would like to play console quality games everywhere and DS is good for one that would like to enjoy new experience of gaming (everywhere). And about the games. Actually, the winner eventually will get better library games since games developer won't make games for the loser anymore. Just like more PS2 games than other consoles. Since PS2 has bigger market. I won't say who's the winner, PSP or DS since I'm afraid it will cloud your judgment. But currently DS sells more than PSP. The final decision is yours. My advice : don't buy PSP if you just play it at home. Better play your X-BOX or PS2."
ds,psp,Which is the better buy PSP or Nintendo DS lite?,"Yes, for years the Gameboy ruled supreme as the handheld of choice....then they did nothing to improve it for 10 years while Sega and Atari both released handheld color units and Sega even bringing out basically a handheld Sega Genesis.

But, those days are over, you're left with Nintendo and now Sony. 

Now, i've used both a DS and a PSP, and the both had thier good points. For starters, DS is Nintendo..a name that's got history, and Sony, they're known for the hip/cool devices. I quite honestly picked a PSP up over a DS becuause the PSP was a sleek unit that i thought a guy my age should carry, vs the DS which looks like it was made for kids and didn't have that flair the PSP did...i didn't wanna be caught sitting on the subway playing a DS.

not to say it isn't good. If you want a lot of the nintendo franchises, it's great. A few of the games that use the touch screen are good, however, i find having to use the screen as a coontrol device in some games is just completely awkard...the PSP has a thumb sick....rock.

the PSP is also not a gaming only device like it's nintendo counterpart. It's got music, movies, both have wifi..with the DS supporting more actual online play than the PSP, which whlile has the ability..i believe the wifi has only ever been used for head-to-head..which is kind of a waste.

I can tell you graphics wise, the PSP's got it. Using a slightly modified PS2 graphics core, the visuals are stunning and a beauty to behold. The DS' graphics are just about on-par with the N64....this is because the DS is only about as powerful as that, plus the usage of memory cards limits what they can do.

UMD's are nice...however, i do remember having problems with one or two of the cases breaking, leaving the games practically unprotected and having to handle the disc to stick it in a case just to play....but they offer a LOT of room so they can do some nice things with the graphics and sound...vs the DS which uses mflash-like technolgy.


but you know, i'm presonally still up in the air. the DS-Lite improved the look, but not the graphics or gameplay...and like i said, i tried playing starfox and i couldn't do it with that screen. I guess i'm just an old school gamer used to the original classic controller configuation and not these new fangled touch screens.  The PSP was able to run some home-written applications for a while, and might still be able to (my psp got stolen) although Sony is tryin to put a stop to it. With that, I was able to emulate all the old NES games on my PSP...which...was really nice because the button configuration almost was similar to a nintendo controler.....Don Flamingo from Punch Out never went down do fast..left-right-left-right-left-right ;)","Yes, for years the Gameboy ruled supreme as the handheld of choice....then they did nothing to improve it for 10 years while Sega and Atari both released handheld color units and Sega even bringing out basically a handheld Sega Genesis.

Im not too sure about the DS but nintendo usually market their machines alot cheaper than the competition and then rip ppl off with their games prices. whereas other manufacturers take a bigger cut in the actual machine and u pay less for the games in the long run."

You can also buy films for it in the UMD format so you can watch films on your PSP!!!!!",PSP talking about 123,"psp is better, their are more options with it as opposed to the ds","That is a simple question to answer. As far as features go, the PSP is by far a better choice, hands down. Price, the nintendo is better, with generally cheaper games. Features of the PSP are: Game system, MP3 player, movie player (UMD or MPeg4), photo keeper, and not to mention wifi internet capabilities.  The DS cant touch any of that.  Hopefully technology will let us burn our own UMD disks for our own entertainment.  I have a 2gb duo card, with a dozen songs, 10 photos, and about 12 movies, with still 800 mb left to store even more.

ds,psp,"Which is better, Nintendo DS Lite or PSP?","Actually, it has been found out that the DS Lite IS compatible for movies, music, pictures, and browsing the internet. However, this does require the purchase of a Max Dock or something (I forget the name). You can find it if you type in movies, etc. for the DS Lite. Now for the PSP. I will admit that the PSP has better games if you want something like GTA or Need for Speed. And it has better graphics. But if you want those cute nintendo games, such as Nintendogs, or Animal Crossing, the DS Lite is certainly for you. The graphics aren't even that bad. Maybe for some not- well-known games, but a lot of them are very fun, regardless. But it pretty much comes down to what types of games you like to play.","Hands and feet up the PSP!!  You can play games, listen to music (ipod) ,go online and check your myspace (computer), watch videos (ipod), put pictures on there (ipod).  Definiently go with the PSP. The DS is so cheap and flimsy.  You will get your moneys worth with a PSP.","I don't know what criteria you would use to judge.  I look at price after initial purchase.  Since Sony lets others write games for them,  their games are going to be less expensive than Nintendo DS Lite.  They will also have more games than the Nintendo.  If price and availability are important to you, go for the PSP.  Just walk into your local Walmart and you will see what I mean.  However, if you are stupid like me and a true Nintendo loyalist, buy the DS.","wat kind of games u like? well ds is kinda for kids, or ppl who wants to play kid games like me =) there alright, and ds is cheaper, but psp can do more things and has gory games =)and dvds and music, sorta like a ipod but ds has wifi(online play), so which one do u like better","i would go with the psp. i make a really thick book out of ordinary computer paper and cut out the shape and size of the psp so i can watch movies in class, i also  cut out 2 game size things so i can watch 3 different movies. you cant do that with a Nintendo light, you probably could but it wont be as cool.","I think the psp, i had a ds light...... i also get mad if i cant beat something lol i got mad and threw it out the window, and no it doesnt work anymore. all you can do on a ds is play games ds games and GBA games the pic chat thingy you can only talk to someone a few feet away. i havent had a psp but i think it holds music and stuff plus its pretty small and it looks cool 2.","ds. psp is pretty cool, but it doesnt have many good games. i was gonna buy it for one psp game, tom clanceys splinter cell essentials, but if i bought it, it would be a complete waste of time because the other games suck. sony only pays attention to there systems more than there games. ps2 and ps1 are the only good game systems from sony. i gave up my ds and all my ds games to get a psp, it was not nearly close enough to the price of a psp itself. so i got 5 old ps2 games for my ds and ds games. it was a huge loss. i still miss my ds. so if your gonna buy one of them, go with ds. psp is a rip off and a waste of time and money.","PSP it has way better things in it like you can go on the Internet on the psp, you can listen to music and download videos on to it.Psp has way better graphics then the ds.","psp is better. i have fifa 2007 and i play online with anybody around the world. plus you can play music and videos, surf the web, and pics. it is also light to carry. you shouldnt think twice. psp is the way to go.",The ds is more for game and innovation and the psp is more for multimedia.,"Actually, it has been found out that the DS Lite IS compatible for movies, music, pictures, and browsing the internet.

The games are great - and it's a new way to play games. I have both the PSP and the DS, and I find the PSP difficult to play certain games because of the little analogue nub.

It also has integrated WiFi capabilities, and the ability to play demos when taken into GameStop stores.  If you have a wireless router that supports the DS, then you can also play multiplayer games over your own internet connection at no additional cost.  You also don't need to worry about a game not working, because unless you run it over with your car, the games are virutally unbreakable. The PSP is a system for people who have the money to spend on all the peripherals that make it that much better.  It has good games to choose from, but has also had problems with screens going out prematurely and discs scratching too easily.

ds,psp,Whats better? DS Lite or PSP?,"PSP is a nice piece of kit with mp3 player, video player, umd player (movies) , wi fi , basic interet, store photos. But the games are pretty much the same as PS2 games.

Nintedo DS lite is not as powerful as the PSP. It has wi fi play and just plays games. However it has a touch screen which changes the way you play games.plus two screens which is very interesting. But the DS has no other extras its just good for orignal games. Games are also £5 - £10 cheaper on the DS. The DS lite is also cheaper. DS games are quick to play on the go and are easy to pick up and play.

The bottom line is the DS lite offers alot of unique games that are not on any other console or the games play alot better due to the touch screen. 90% of the PSP's games are on the PS2 and they play better on the PS2 BUT the PSP is a nice gadget and the games are still good.

A big point is whether or not he is a ""Nintendo""/orignal game fan then if he doesnt have a console at the moment. If he is not I would imagine he would enjoy the PSP alot more.

I have a DS, but the PSP has better stuff.",PSP hands DOWN!,yip get him the psp,WWW.PS3SignUp.COM,psp so all my friends ar telling me!,No Contest - PSP. DS Lite is absolutely rubbish,PSP!,"I prefer the PSP.   The reason why it hasn't taken off is b/c it's typically more expensive than the DS Lite (which is geared more towards kids and broke students). The PSP is technologically more advanced than the DS Lite...it's like PS1.5 packed into a tiny unit (in other words, almost as powerful as a PS2). The nice thing about the PSP is that it has multiple capabilities...your husband will love using it not only as a game unit, but for viewing AVI movies, for which the PSP is still the best portable for that purpose (topping out the iPod video and its tiny little screen).       I bring the PSP with me to the gym to catch up on t.v., and also on long airplane flights.    Some minor points to worry about: 1)   To make use of either the DS Lite or PSP while he's in the gym or on a plane, he will need a pair of noise-isolation earbuds from either etymotic or shure.     That'll cost anywhere from an extra $100-$200.    2)  The PSP requires an extra memory card to do all the fancy movie stuff.    1 GB memory stick duo pro runs about $60 on sale, and the 2 GB is....$80 on sale?    Keep your eyes peeled for sales at frys or best buy, etc.  The DS Lite is not without its merits...it has good group games but that doesn't sound like something your husband is going to be involved with.      One great game that's entertaining that I've tried is Trauma Center, you can get that off of Amazon but none of the retail stores sell it anymore.      I have both systems, I like the PSP better.    For people who are working, it's just the better alternative even if the numbers in sales don't reflect that. I just bought a bunch of titles 2 weeks ago, here are some that you might want to get for him: Lumines Lumines 2 Syphon Filter:  Dark Mirror  (fun!  Playing it now....)

ds,psp,wat are the biggest differences between the ds and psp?,"Their are serveral differences between the two systems. The PSP graphics are a little better, but the DS makes up for it in several ways. The DS has a cool touch screen that you can use stylus for. Many DS games require you to use this screen. In sonic when you go up a loop you actually go up the next screen, so you go from bottom screen to top screen, its actually pretty cool. I believe them games are much funner to play on the DS, but this is only person opinion. They both connect online to play other people wirelessly. The PSP allows you to surf the internet, the DS does not. The DS also has a mic so you can use it for blowing into. This is required for some games. The DS has Nintendo 64 graphics, while the PSP had playstation graphics. The DS is also backward campatible with the GBA games. The price for a DS is also alot cheaper then a PSP. The PSP can be used like an mp3 player, and also uses flash drives to store saved games on or play music. The psp can also be used to emulate older consoles like nes and snes. PSP made the future games need an update for them to run, that no longer allow you to emulate consoles anymore.

Their is probably a hack for this though.","I just bought a DS and I can tell you this.  There is about a $100 price difference between the two.  They are both good handhelds.  The DS had two screens which is really fun, like having two monitors for a pc (really amazing once you get used to it).  They both have wifi.  With the PSP, you will get better graphics but the DS also has good graphics and really fun games.  The biggest difference between the two systems is the touchpad on the DS.  It allows for a totally new gaming experience.  The Dual screen support also adds to the unique experience as the actions goes from one screen to the other or one screen is used for a inventory screen while the other is what you're mainly focusing on to play.  I would highly recommend getting the DS as it's cheaper, still has equally great games, the DS Lite looks really cool in itself (kinda like an ipod) and is very interesting to play in many ways.  Trust me, you won't regret getting one.   As a sidenote, the screens on the DS Lite is equivalent or near equivalent to the PSP screen.  The color and resolution is very good on both.  The original DS screens, though,  were not so great.  I also shy away from Sony Consoles because they tend to have disk read errors.  The DS can't have that because it uses cartridges similar to an SD memory card and therefore has no moving parts.","um. the biggest differences? Sony Makes the PSP, Nintendo makes the DS. The DS has 2 screens. One screen is touch sensitive the DS has less buttons The DS screens aren't as large or detailed as the PSP's. The PSP can play movies and music.(without the need of hacking) The PSP graphics are better. at this time, only the PSP can browse the internet (however the DS is supposed to be getting a browser). The DS has alot more games, being that you can play GBA games as well. The DS is Kid oriented The PSP is more adult oriented (games are more mature). Basically the PSP can do more and better. But thats not always what people want. The DS is for the common gamer. If you like nintendo you will like the DS (and the Wii)."
ds,psp,which is better ds or psp?,"It all depends on what you want to do.  If you want to play games, listen to music, watch movies, etc...then you'll want a PSP, simply because the DS doesn't do those things.  If you're looking simply for a handheld gaming console, go with the DS--the touchscreen is just so cool to use and it's awesome to see how different developers incorporate that feature into their games.  In addition, there are a lot of good games spanning a wide variety of genres for the DS.  That's not to say the PSP didn't have good games--it just didn't have enough to make it a good gaming investment (my roommate returned his after playing Mercury and MegaMan Maverick Hunters).

And in my personal opinion, the PSP felt a little bulky in my hands, and the little ""nub"" it's got (that's somehow supposed to substitute for a control stick) is hard to use with the precision that the games require.

Games you should check out for the DS to get you started:
Meteos - falling brick-style puzzle game, easy to learn and unending difficulty potential
Tetris DS - well...it's Tetris.  'Nuff said.
MarioKart DS - it's MarioKart, and you can't go wrong there, either.
New Super Mario Bros - A complete reimagining of the 2D platformer, incredible nostalgic value on this one.
Starfox Command - great combat flyer and good use of the touchscreen.
Metroid Prime Hunters - it's like Metroid Prime, but with other cool bounty hunters and multiplayer.
Brain Age - an amusing educational game that is supposed to activate the prefrontal cortex in your brain.  Basically keeps parts of your mind active that don't do much once you're out of school--it's fun if you're into that kind of thing.
Nintendogs - it's a really fancy Tamagotchi (remember those?)--you have a little puppy that you feed and play with and stuff.  I've heard it's fun, anyway.

Those should get you started, there are tons more and of course what you play is all dependant upon your tastes.
http://www.gamestop.com/ - if you search through their list of DS games, you'll probably find something else that looks cool, too.

Oh, and the DS also plays GBA games.  Hope all that helps, good luck!

~Scottie","PSP is best.  I don't own one but my mate does, when I visit I play Everybody Golf all day.  It's addictive.","Psp the disks are cool, Madden 07 midnight club3 dub edition Gun  Cars Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories NBA 07 Miami Vice",The PSP is the better then the DS,"Both of the systems have their pros and cons.   The main things to look at in a hand-held video game system are: graphics, features, games, price, and durability. Your age is also a factor in deciding which one you would enjoy the most. Both systems are really fun but, nine times out of ten one will suit you more than the other.   Nintendo DS:   Pros: The price is the first thing to look at. The price is currently $129.99. This is a fair price for what you get. First, it has a built-in Game Boy Advance. The price of a Game Boy Advance SP on its own is $79.99. That means that the DS part is only $50. The DS has great graphics for its price! That is not all, it even has two screens. One is a regular screen, but the other is touch screen. It is used for anything from petting a dog to aiming a gun. Last, but not least, you can play online. This means that if you have a wireless router at home you can play for free. If you do not have a wireless router, you can pay $35 for an adapter.  Online you can race, shoot and play with people across the world.   Cons: If you are looking for more mature, traditional gaming, the DS will probably disappoint you.  The Nintendo DS offers a wide selection of innovative games that focus on using the touch screen.  The touch screen is both a pro and a con.  In the game “Greg Hastilings Tournament Paintball Max,” aiming with the touch screen while pressing buttons to fire and reload can be a pain.  One other issue with the touch screen is that the stylus is easy to lose.  DS comes with two of them, but you can purchase three more for around $5.00.         Sony PSP: Pros: Sony PSP is a sleek, nice looking, hand-held gaming system made by Sony. It is designed to attract the “I-pod audience.” This system can connect to the internet, play movies, hold photos, and play music. The PSP has graphics similar to the Play Station 2[1].  The games look really nice on the PSP. This system is the only hand-held system to have a mini built-in joystick. The joystick is so small that you can barely see it in pictures, but it works really well.  The stick makes racing, shooting, and walking a lot easier. PSP also has arrow keys for tasks such as moving through menus, entering text, and performing more precise functions. As if that were not enough, this work of art can connect to the internet, and surf the web.   Cons:  Every positive on the PSP comes with a negative.  The games offered on the PSP aren’t very innovative.  Most of the games have previous versions which appear on other TV based systems (Nintendo Game Cube, Microsoft Xbox (360), and Sony Play Station 2).  The ones on the TV based systems are usually longer and easier to navigate because their controllers have more , larger buttons. Music and photo storage are cool features, but are limited by the PSP’s memory.  If you want to store more than five songs or ten pictures you would have to buy a memory stick, which can cost between $30 - $100.  You can buy movies to play on the PSP, but many movies don’t come in this format.  There is software that converts regular DVDs to the PSP format, but this costs around $40, and requires at least an $80 memory card.  The movie Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith, for example, took up one gigabyte of memory!  The Internet connection is a great idea, but it’s really hard to navigate.  It’s difficult to enter text, but it’s even more difficult to correct mistakes.  The last point is that the screen breaks very easily.  A good, hard screen protector costs an additional $15, but it’s well worth it.      Conclusion: Overall, they both have many great features and some drawbacks.  It all comes down to which system you prefer.  If you are attracted to new technology developments, then you are a Nintendo DS person.  If you enjoy more traditional, familiar games then Sony PSP is for you.","It all depends on what you want to do.

ds,psp,what is better Nintendo ds or psp?,"Both are excellent machines but offer something different.

The PSP is technically superior, offering better graphics, sound and can double as an mp3 player, mpeg4/umd video player and photo viewer.  It has a smaller range of good games though this is improving; and their are more titles that would appeal to older players.

The DS is better value for money and has a good range of high quality games and better support for internet play through Ninendo's excellent wi-fi service.  While the graphics and sound aren't as good, it does have some unique features like a touch screen and microphone.

Theres no definite answer to which is better; have a look at the games available for each system and decide based on which you would rather be playing.","Well, PSP is much better.","PSP all the way-internet, better controls, awesome screen to play videos on...just better all the way around",To tell the truth the psp are better but I like the nintendo ds.,"Both are excellent machines but offer something different.

ds,psp,Which is best for a 5yr old boy to play a PSP or Nintendo DS Lite?,"I have both systems, and the Nintendo DS Lite is definitely the better choice for a young boy.  The PSP is a very delicate piece of technology which can be easily broken.  It's basically a miniature computer.  It's also aimed at an older demographic, so there isn't a whole lot of games for younger players.  

The DS Lite is built to be abused.  It closes like a clam shell to protect the screens.  Most games are made to be accessible to children.  Controls are simple and intuitive.  The DS can be played 20 hours before a recharge is needed.  The PSP gets 3 hours, tops.  The DS also has a much simpler wifi interface, making it easy for friends to play against eachother.","I have both systems, and the Nintendo DS Lite is definitely the better choice for a young boy.

Plus it has amazing added features.","This really depends on what kind of games you like, I also was making this decision a few months ago and I'm now positive I went for the right choice. I got a DS and the reason I would say this is better for me is that I like fun games and I'm not too keen on sports or shooting games. What the DS lacks on MP3, internet, video playing etc it gains on the fact that the games are more interactive by using the built in microphone and the touch screen. Also if your mates have a DS you can do download play where you only need one cartridge between you and you can play each other wirelessly. I have spoken to two of my friends who have both consoles and they say they like the PSP but find that they use their DS much more. Hope this helps.","I say the DS.  Why?  You can actually buy an upgrade to let your DS play MP3 files, video files, and later, the Opera web browser cartdridge will be made, letting you surf the web.  The battery can last longer without the need of upgrading. The PSP requires alot of upgrades.  A protection case, battery pack,  sound dock so you can watch movies with better sound. The DS is pretty durable, has an 18 hour battery life if you have the new DS, but we don't have any kind of sound dock.","Nintendo DS Pros: - Spectacularly good software selection - Redesigned, extra-small hardware in DS Lite - Cheap and durable Cons: - Less technically advanced than the PSP - Has no other cons.

If the DS has more games you like but it.  Same for the PSP. **********My PSP Rant********** True, the PSP can play music and you can watch movies but it does neither of these things very well.  That is the usual problem with these types of multi-task devices; they do many different things, but none of them well. As an mp3 player the PSP is one of the larger and more difficult to use and you have to buy expensive Sony memory sticks to expand the memory of the system. As a movie player the PSP is a joke.  Let's think about this for a minute.  Who is going to sit in front of this thing for 2 hours to watch a movie?  Answer:  no one.  This novelty will wear off about 45 minutes into your first movie.  Don't forget that if you want to watch one of your favorite movies, you have to spend another 15 to 20 bucks to buy it on a UMD.  The UMD is failing miserably and probably won’t be around much longer.  Studios are losing money and will not continue the production of these disks soon. With some modification and downloads, you can surf the web wirelessly (although not very well; another novelty that will be as useless as watching movies after about 10 minutes) as well as download and store all kinds of media in the device.(buy a video ipod for this instead).  **********End Rant**********  it all boils down to the games.  Nintendo has dominated the handheld market for 10 years because they know handhelds are mainly for younger players and produce the majority of their games accordingly. Adults simply don’t have as much time to play mobile games.  When we go somewhere (adults), it is for a reason, not because we are being dragged by our parents and need something to pass the time. My advice is do not buy either if you are over 15, you simply wont use it.","trust me i had a psp but i traded it in for a DS. I got the DS because it takes along time to download songs on to the psp. pictures are faster than songs but to download anything off the computer you need to download a service called PSPWare. type in pspware on google to keep looking  for a place to download it. well i just found the place for you. ill attatch it to the soursce.but to use the internet on the psp (it has internet along with videos,songs,pictues) you need to be near a computer.its stupid cause if your near the computer then why dont you jsut use the computer? i say get the ds. it has an alarm!!!! and a bunch of other great things",psp.

Make sure you look at previews of upcoming games too, so you have an idea of what's around the corner.",ds and psp,360 best in terms of a high def gaming system with all the extra gadets on the controler but psp better if you travel a lot or have a small tv only catch about psp and 360 is accessoires cost more then ds lite so what yourreally asking for is are you willing to pay around $500- $900 on psp or 360 or for ds lite around$300-500,"Well if you're talkin about power, the Xbox 360 wins.","it depends. those are two different categories you are talking about. psp and ds are portable handheld systems. they do not have the raw power that the 360 has. i owned a psp at one point and i have to say i was very disappointed. the games were bad and expensive, the battery life sucked, it got smudged easily, and the wifi was difficult to use. i have a ds lite currently and i love it. it has great games that are cheap, it fits in my pocket, it looks cool, the battery life is great, and the unique touch screen and microphone are tons of fun. i don't have a 360 but i used to work on one when i was a game tester at thq. i worked on saints row. the 360 was ok, but it was not worth all the hype. the games look ok but unless you have a hi-def television it seems pointless. out of all three i would recommend a ds. some may disagree but i think that is your best bet. good luck.","the 360 is way better than the rest...If you need a console system.   the PSP is more expensive, but looks better as far as a portable. But the DS is bar far the best bet for your money, it is the cheapest and can do almost everything the same as a PSP (Music, movies ,mp3's,homebrew)  check out the super card or the movie player for the DS, I download 100's of roms at a time, it doesnt get any better than free games..."
ds,psp,Which would you get and why - Nintendo DS Lite or Sony PSP?,"Sony PSP  because it can hold music, play games, and play movies, and had a camera. Its alot better than the Nintendo DS Lite","Sony PSP  because it can hold music, play games, and play movies, and had a camera. Its alot better than the Nintendo DS Lite",I would go with the PSP.,Get the DS.  The new Lite cost 129.99 and the game are more funner than the PSP.  I have both but I play my DS more than I play the PSP.  Soon you will be able to surf the net and watch TV on it.,I would visit some of the games sites out there. To start I suggest: http://www.gamespot.com http://www.ign.com Go through the DS and PSP sections on both sites and check out stuff like 'Latest Reviews,"Top Games' and if you have even more time browse the reviews library. If you have fast connectivity, try sampling some of the game clips so you have an idea of the games. Other sites to try, although not directly game related, are community content sites like the latest ones: http://www.flickr.com http://www.youtube.com There are a bunch of content users around the world upload to share. It's really fun to go through because you don't have to waste your time going down to some shop just to do product investigation. Good luck! PS, Please let me know your decision. I own a Nintendo DS (no Lite :) I think the PSP is nice but I wouldn't think about it unless Sony stops using the UMD format. I'm actually contemplating upgrading to the Lite but only when the price is good. hehe","In the handheld gaming industry, your system has to stand out. It has to have original gameplay, innovative techonology, and that WOW factor. For sure, you should get the DS Lite. Much better games than the PSP. The DS has original games like Brain Age, Nintendogs, WarioWare, and Trauma Center. All of the PSP games are not original (aside from Lumines, but Tetris DS is much better). Any of the PSP games out there you can basically get on a PS2 or any other console. The touch screen provides such an element of creative gameplay and innovative techonology, it's unbelievable! For the PSP, sure it's a music player, but if you have a laptop or MP3 Player, you don't need it. It can play movies, but UMD movies are too expensive and again, your laptop can play DVDs. The DS's wow factor is a 5/5. With awesome games ahead, there's no telling how great the DS will be (especilly when the Wii arrives).","A ds for lots of fun games, a psp for roadtrip cuz it has a couple fun games movies and its and mp3 player (cant use itunes, try http://musicstore.connect.com a sony site)",The Nintendo DS...News Flash the Nintendo DS is outselling the Sony PSP and the PS2............ign.com/g4.com/,PSP i have one but there really hard to work,"Neither because the Game Boy Advance SP is fun enough for a car trip and where else do you really need to use a hand-held?  I would think that the DS Lite would be okay, the original was so damned heavy it gave you carpal tunnel.  As far as features, the PSP has more, but if you have an iPod and a computer, it won't really add that much.  I've been told that you'll get tired of it after a week.","I have a DS lite, an original DS, and a PSP.   I find that DS has more 'fun' games.  While PSP has much better looking games.  The DS lite is quite a bit smaller than the original DS. If you have big hands, you may find your hands cramp up depend on how often and how long you play.   While it is true that PSP can play back music, video from memory stick, and UMD.  But who doesn't have an iPod or another mp3 player these days?  You need to buy a large memory stick 1-2gb+ to really use the PSP as a mp3 player.  And UMD discs are more expensive than regular DVDs, I bought one just to see how it looks and it does look great on the PSP screen.  Many of the PSP games are just ports/re-hash of what's available on PS2. It's a tough decision.  But I'd go with the DS lite because of the game library.","Calvin said: It's a tough decision. But I'd go with the DS lite because of the game library.  That is not quite true! Some of the best games for psp are as follows:  Grand theft auto: liberty city stories, Syphon filter Dark Mirror, Pursuit force, Smackdown vs Raw 2006, Daxter, Star wars Battlefront 2 Coming soon: Grand theft auto vice city stories, Starwars lego 2, Grand turismo 4 mobile, Metal gear solid portable ops, Killzone liberation, LocoRoco, Gangs of London"

There aren't any games for DS....,"Both systems have pros and cons. The PSP has a larger screen, amazing graphics and the capability to play movies, music, store pictures, more games available to play and many other cool features that you can download and install. The DS, while it can really only play games, has the innovative touch screen, which enhances the way some games are played. It's not really a question of which system is better - it's a question of what do you WANT your portible system to do. I've told gamers who express the the desire to get an iPod to just get a PSP because it can do everything an iPod can do and TONS more. For someone like me, though, who would hardly EVER use any of the other features available on the PSP and would use it primarily to play games (depending on what games you want to play) the DS is less expensive and there are plenty of fun games available to for it.  Another question to ask is who is the system for because the PSP is geared mostly towards an older crowd with more violent games being available for it. The DS is geared for everyone with a lot of games made for a younger crowd and the community of gamers that like puzzle/thinking/strategy games.  Both systems are awesome if you ask me.

ds,psp,Which is the better handheld game now PSP or Nintendo DS?,"The ds is better than the psp

Ten reasons why a ds is better than a psp

1) Most of the ds games are original and only released for that format - nearly all the psp games have been also released (or due to be released) on the ps2. 

2) The ds is a lot more reliable - psp's are too fragile.

3) The psp is more interested in graphics than game content. Game content is much more important to me than graphics.  I can spend hours playing the awesome highly addictive game Pong on my ds (one of the games on Retro Atari) which much more fun than some of them psp games.  Big suprise Pong is not out on the psp. 

4) The batteries on a psp dont last as long as a ds's.

5) There are too many 'add ons' on a psp that are not necassary for a games console while a ds just does what a games console is designed to do which is play games.

6) More ds consoles have been sold than psp's.

7) The ds has awesome wireless multiplayer action and only one of the players need to have the game

8) The ds has awesome touch screen technology and built in microphone which a lot of ds games take full advantage off.

9) There are more games out on a ds than a psp.

10) The ds is backward compatible for gameboy advanced games.",The ds is better than the psp Ten reasons why a ds is better than a psp 1) Most of the ds games are original and only released for that format - nearly all the psp games have been also released (or due to be released) on the ps2.  2) The ds is a lot more reliable - psp's are too fragile. 3) The psp is more interested in graphics than game content.

As for the media properties, you'll need to hack the heck out of your PSP, drop a small fortune on Flash memory sticks, or drop a bunch on UMD movies. The DS is a great little system, plus the DS Lite is a huge step up from its bulky predecessor. Nintendo has done a great job of bringing their best franchises to the system, and third-party support has ramped up significantly. It's also a lot more affordable than the PSP, ringing up at $129.99 (the PSP rings up at $249.99). You won't need to worry about memory for game saves, because it all gets saved on to game cartridges. The DS also plays Gameboy Advance games, and with the new media pack and 4 gig memory pack (It's only $149. A 1 gig memory stick for the PSP is $99), you can rip movies, music and TV to your DS too. And let's not forget the Wi-Fi support for online gaming. Trust me, a lack of killer apps for the PSP has had mine collecting dust. I just haven't had a lot of reasons to use it. Go with the DS Lite."
ds,psp,Should I get a PSP or a DS?,Save your money. Get a Wii.  Wii's will rock.,Save your money. Get a Wii.  Wii's will rock.,"PSP as they seems to have more games/movies, etc. However, they will come out with a new one after the PS3 (probably), and then you'll have to upgrade ... again.","get a PSP !!! DS is good to bud PSP is better , and yes save money buy a WII",You should get neither. Both portable systems have rather lukewarm ratings and really not worth the cash. Stick to your good old fashioned gameboy and save up for PS3.,"I would get both if I could afford it, but the PSP would be stuck on the shelf until some decent games from Square Enix finally come out.  I'm not impressed with the current selection of games for the PSP, and would rather watch movies on a big screen television and listen to music on a better MP3 player.      Though I enjoy playing with my DS, I do not like how screens for hand-helds in general have a high risk of being scratched.  Especially with the DS's touch screen.",both are good but the ds bateery last way more time then the one on the psp also the screen is  to sensitive i dot a ds and my cousin who has psp her screen get scratch very easy,"get the psp or get the nintendo wii, they atre both amazing, believe me, i have them. do not get the ds or the ds lite, there is  no coparison with the psp",psp,PSP,"u should get the PSP! and i will then bu u da DS! that will b better, cause then u will get both! yay! im sooo smart!","well, that depends, I would say a PSP over a DS, if you can afford it. For one, PSP can hook u to the internet, can let u watch movies, and acts as an MP3 player PLUS all the things DS do. DS is heavy and the graphics are not as crisp. Of course, if you can wait, maybe tyou want to check out some of the new consoles first.",you should get a psp because u can download music. watch movies. plzy games. store pics anad go online.  PLZ tell me if a crappy ds can do that!,"PSP, i have both  psp is worth the money, it does more than a ds, trust me .  ( wii's will save you money!!!!) and is just like a psp","I would get a PSP because of the graphics and all of the other things including watching movies, viewing pictures from a camera, and listening to music. The DS only really serves Mario games and other Japanese games. And it doesn't feature all of the things that the PSP does. So I would get a PSP.",a psp,"It depends what you want and admire in a system.  If you are looking to play unique, great games at an unbeatable price, go for the DS.  If you want to pay lots more money and be able to watch UMDs and listen to music then buy a PSP. DS  pros: long battery life, GREAT games that are cheaper than PSP games, GREAT online capabilities, CHEAPER price than PSP, wonderful innovation with the touch screen, more sturdier than PSP cons: the graphics are not as good as the PSP, cannot play movies or music (yet) PSP pros: nice screen, plays UMDs and music, can surf the net cons:  very few games to choose from, VERY expensive system that has a propensity to break easily (its fragile), lackluster online support My vote is for the DS, HANDS DOWN.  The PSP is not a great gaming system, only get it if you want to play UMDs and music.",Its kinda obvious...you should get a PSP..but If I were you...neither...a portable console is not that hot...the only thing you have in it is...well...its portable...its and mp3 player...but c'mon...its bigger than its worth...movies...if there's a rental UMD maybe its a good thing...but a UMD is too expensive for 2 hours... ;),"I agree with Southpaw, the Wii will rock, but out of the choices, it comes down to your gaming preference. Some people just can't stand Nintendo. Personally, I thoroughly enjoy my DS and would recommend it over the PSP any day.",i have a ds but a psp is better!,"get a ds lite, ds allows wi-fi play, it has a touch screen, there is wireless play, and there are even games to improve your brainpower","get a PSP, MUCH BETTER TO USE.","DS!! dont listen to all these people they dont know what their talking about. first of all PSP has no games and sony isnt coming out with any more. second, DS has the best games and they are way cheaper. new super mario bros, animal crossing, mario kart, metroid prime, big brain academy plus many more. the ds has free wi-fi and nintendo is actually making games for it. not to mention its cheaper.  the only good thing about the PSP is the internet.","psp, of course",PSP look at the ads on tv.

ds,psp,"wich is best, the PSP or the NINTENDO DS?",psp because you can do alot more then just play games,"For the most entertainment, I have to say the PSP.  Other than playing games, you can surf the internet, watch movies, play music, and download features. But for battery life, I'll pick the DS. You can get more battery life for the PSP but it will cost you more.",Well honestly that question depends on what you are looking for. I personally have both. I use my PSP as my MP3 player and my DS as a gaming machine. I love them both but for different reasons. So the best question should be.....What are you looking for in a 'Portable gaming system'? I dont have many games for my PSP but I have at least 5 movies which that was my purpose for getting it and I have maybe five for my DS which was the reason I got it. SO I didnt answer your question but hopefully you will be able to ask questions of yourself in order to answer it yourself.,"i pre-ordered the DS and had it when it first came out, it had no good games at the time and still doesnt so i sold it like 3 months after i got it. now i have the psp and it is so awsome, u can do anything(almost) with it! plus it has good games and way better graphics","if u like watching movies , looking at photos, listening to music and having your portable system brake every three seconds... the psp. if u like fun games an affordable price and two screens... the ds  Source(s): psp braking, not being able to download music off itunes onto psp, looking at all the good games for ds",psp because you can do alot more then just play games

PSP or DS?","MICROSOFT, i enjoy all its fun games.",Wii and psp the wii is just different  and the psp is like a hand held ps2,xbox 360 should overall be the best ....but i havent seen the graphics but like the guy said xbox 360 and ps3 are more crisp and the graphics are better...... xbox is the overall rating between ps2 and gamecube you dont have to buy memory and the grpahics are way better... i own the ds and psp n i prefer the psp all the way psp has more options like mp3 photos n the internet,xbox 360.....but the new nintendo will be called the wii,"For the first question, I highly recommend you read my previous answer to this question at [http://tinyurl.com/mz6e5]. It's quite detailed. For the second, well, it's all about the games. Gamecube has a radically different lineup than the PS2 and Xbox, so it depends on what you're looking for. PS2 and Xbox have similar lineups (a lot of cross-platform games between the two), so the real deciding factor is the franchises - do you like the Xbox-specific games like Halo, or the PS2-specific games like Jak & Daxter? I personally own both a PS2 and a GameCube and love them both. I also have an Xbox 360, so I can play some of the Xbox games, but I only have 2 and probably won't get any others. And with DS vs PSP, if you want to play games the clear winner is the DS. It has the much more innovative and engaging control interface (dual screens, touch screen, microphone, etc) and has a lot more and better games for it. There's a reason the DS is outselling the PSP by about 10 to 1. Pretty much the only reason to get a PSP is if you really want to watch movies on a tiny little screen. And personally, I know of *nobody* who wants that. There's a good reason Sony's UMD format is a huge flop.","Definately the Wii. The 360 and PS3 are for people who want crisp, clear graphics. The Wii is for those who want to have fun.","MICROSOFT, i enjoy all its fun games.",its not called the revolution anymore. its the nintendo wii.,"out of ps3, xbox 360, and the wii id have to say the 360 cuz its the only 1 u can play so far and own out of xbox, ps2, gamecube id have to say xbox cuz its got the best graphics and u dont have to but a memory card out of psp, ds id have to say psp because more ppl have it ur welcome :), Dacadac","For me, it's a tossup between Gamecube and PS2.  I have them both...it just depends on what games I want to play...but I think the PS2 is more versatile.  But I like it better than XBox anyway because I just don't like the Xbox's controllers.  too big.  I just read up on the ps3 though, and i think that sounds much better than xbox360, but I don't have $500.  so....the nintendo wii sounds like a lot more fun and *cough* affordable"

The micro is the same as the advance plus the DS plays those games as well. The PSP I can't get into.

apple,microsoft,Apple vs Microsoft - which do you like better?,"I switched from PC to Mac about 2 years ago, after becoming familiar with Macs using my sister's computer. I will NEVER go back to PCs. I use them at work, and I so appreciate not seeing the 'blue screen of death' anymore. I also like that Macs are simplified for basic things such as photos, music, internet and e-mail. Truthfully, the only programs I have issues with are Microsoft applications like Word and IE. I use a Canon camera, Epson printer, and an Apple iPod. You just plug them in and use them. no sweat. I got a refurbished eMac and am about to get an iPod from the apple store's refurbished section as well. 

I think Apple's superiority comes from the fact that Macs are inherently more stable systems since everything is manufactured by apple instead of having a microsoft operating system, pentium processor, etc. 

As for compatibility (which is what scares most people about the switch) I have very few problems. The only things that dont' work for me are Google Earth and Yahoo! Games. 2 things I DO NOT need to further waste time at home online!!

It has a larger screen, the ability to exchange songs with other Zunes wirelessly due the to fact that it is WIFi-based and a built-in FM radio.

'If I didn't already have an iPod - and had not already invested lots of money in songs and videos downloaded from the iTunes media store - the Zune might be tempting.

The built-in 802.11 b/g WiFi radio is good only for Zune to Zune wireless song transfers, although there's no technical reason Microsoft couldn't open it up to allow wireless syncing with your PC, or wireless song downloads from the Zune Marketplace. Microsoft says Zune will eventually become a family of products, so many of the issues that vex the first Zune could be addressed in future devices. The Zune Marketplace will certainly evolve to add more music, as well as video and audio books. But for now, the iPod and iTunes system is superior to anything else on the market.

All in all, they're both pretty good and they both have their flaws.  But you can't really compare them to each other.  It's kind of like comparing apples to oranges.  Just use the one you feel more comfortable with.",It depends on what you like and what you want.,"It depends. If you're looking for a company that markets cool technology, Apple all the way. If you're looking for a company that makes cool technology, then it's Microsoft. Apple has made iPods... but MP3 players are old news. The capacities and tech were cool when they were coming from Archos and Creative, but while Apple has popularized the technology (and supported DRM :P) it hasn't really done anything innovative with it. I don't have a great deal of experience with OS X, but I do have plenty with FreeBSD and other *nix operating systems. You can't beat a unix when it comes to shear power, stability or customization... but again, Apple is just standing on the shoulders, and slapping a UI on top. Nothing really interesting. Historically, Mac has a terrible track record of making things overly user-friendly... have you ever needed to fix an old one, and spent hours trying to find what keyboard contortions to hold at power on to get the right menu? I have, and no thanks. Apple will need to do something a lot cooler than overcharging for laptops in glossy white shells before they'll be worth trying again. All that being said, the xbox and 360 aren't all that innovative either. They're just game consoles, albeit with a dedicated internet service attached. For innovation in games, you need to look at Nintendo. Windows, though, is something else again. Sure, in the beginning, maybe it started as borrowed concepts, and no, it hasn't always been the stablest system. What it does do, though, is run 90% of the computers in the world well enough to run almost any application. That's everything from high end phones to workstations to high performance systems and servers. They're even doing stuff for clustered computing these days, and they're the de-facto standard platform for almost all professionaly developed software. While not strictly 'innovation,' it's a fair feat no less, and they're improving it all the time.",eee.. call me old fashioned but im one for Microsoft.,"Microsoft is easier to use, it's more user friendly!!!!!!  But Apple is not bad either! I recommend both!","It depends.  What do you want to do? If you want to play games, Microsoft wins hands down.  Xbox, Xbox 360, PC games, game studios, publishing, technology (DirectX).  Apple doesn't have a prayer. If you want to listen to music & be hip w/ pop-culture, get an iPod.  Microsoft doesn't make any hardware for this though they provide software to play the music. Microsoft doesn't build PCs, just the operating system, middleware, & apps.  Apple makes all of those. For computing, it depends on what you are used to.  If you have a Mac and are accustomed to it, stick with it.  If you have a Windows machine, it does everything you need it to anyway.  Stick with it unless you want to replace all your apps with the Apple equivalent.  All the machines, OS's, and apps will do what you need.  While we're on the topic, why not throw in Unix/Linux? For creative apps (Adobe & Macromedia) or Maya, it's made for both Windows and MacOS so there's no difference.  If you're doing home video, Macs might be better.  If you're using 3DS Max for 3D modelling & animation, go with Windows and render with a Linux farm. Creativity should have very little to do with the tools. Pricing?  The Wintel platform is much more affordable for just about everything.  Ease-of-use may be a matter of perspective. So..., what do you want to do? Addendum:  put Windows on a Mac.  You're done.","I use windows, but i have noticed that when i have used apple, it never has any problams, but you cant install new hard ware.

nokia,samsung,"which brand of mobile phone do you think is the best - nokia, motorola, samsung, etc??..?","Well this is not an easy question to answer. Never the less it is a pretty good question and an interesting one too.

Let's analyze. Companies like Samsung, LG etc are basically consumer electronics companies. Their product line ranges from TVs to DVD players on one side and mobile phone to CD/DVD writers on the other. They also assemble PCs and manufacture LCD/Plasma screens. For example, a company like LG focuses most of its attention (and resources) to LCD screens and Plasma TVs as it is a high profit business. For them mobile phone is an instrument to complete their product line.

On the other hand, companies like Nokia and Motorola are pure communication companies. They are the ones that develop new technologies like Bluetooth, MMS etc. Since their core activity (and their means of earning their bread and butter) is wireless communication, their mobile phones will always be most customer friendly. Moreover, their after sales service would also be comparatively better to companies like Samsung, LG etc.

However, the choice of a mobile phone is very personal and individualistic. Therefore, one will have to look at what one needs to buy rather than what the companies want to sell. The above analysis would help him or her to make a wise decision.","Well this is not an easy question to answer. Never the less it is a pretty good question and an interesting one too. Let's analyze.

None is better than the other.  For instance, an apple computer is great for graphic design, while a dell or ibm have features such as microsoft, etc.",The best computer is one which has the best processor.Best Processor equals best performance. Dell uses Intel process exclusively. IBM uses either Intel or AMD processors. Apple has its own processor.Neither Apple or AMD base their performance on old concept that the more Megahertz the processor had the better it was.  First Apple then AMD have proven that Megahertz alone is not a very good way to measure the computers performance.  Apple does not use the Windows operating system.  If you use to Windows then you will find Apple confusing.  It is my belief that the best computer is one which uses an AMD64 processor.  Recent reports are that the AMD is the number one desktop computer sold in the retail market for general home use.  And the best news is that a computer with an AMD processor is generally hundreds of dollars less expensive than one using Intel.  Performance testing in recent years have proved over and over that an AMD powered computer of say 2100 Megahurtz performs as well or in most cases better than an Intel powered computer operating at 3400 Megahertz.
apple,dell,is the internet on an apple quicker than a Dell?,"As a major Mac user and Fan of Apple. I regret to say NO.

That does not mean the machine is inherently slow, it has a lot to do with how the software interacts and how the website is written.

A Dell uses Microsoft Windows. Internet Explorer is built into the OS. A Mac uses afari as a browser. While components are built in, it is still a separate application.

Safari is one of the few Standards compliant browsers. That makes it very good at following the rules for HTML CSS, etc. But it also means many sites can confuse it and even break it when you visit and not work properly.

This and some other issues related to network use, makes browsing on the Mac slightly slower on all pages, and noticeable slower on a few poorly coded pages.

This slight performance gap will son be remedied with updates to the OS and hardware in upcoming weeks.

HP does design unique features into their computers, a few listed below as you are particularly interested in media use.

QuickPlay

BTW...you're starting to look at at a good time of year w/ the holiday 'deals' coming up!

A bit more on HP service be sure you invest in additional coverage) HP backs their laptops w/ industry-standard one-year warranty; the cost to extend the term to three years is a *reasonable* $85. Toll-free telephone support is available 24/7 during your warranty period, and the HP support Web site includes real-time chat with a tech rep (very cool!).

Some other observations re 'Why HP':
-Dell makes none of the computer parts (they use the cheapest stuff they can get)
---HP made the audio equipment for the Disney movie Fantasia!
---HP makes more than just computers
-cameras
-printers/scanners
-projectors
-calculators

Dell Compaq (compaq now owned by HP) HP IBM Toshiba Sony The thing to understand about computers is that while they have a different BRAND NAME, and perhaps a different BODY design, the chipsets inside of them are all the same... In other words, no matter what company you buy from, there is going to be an INTEL processor inside of it, or AMD. In other words, its like having BMW, TOYOTA or HONDA, all different brands, but if they all had the same exact engine, it wouldnt really matter... What you want to look for, is customer support experiences, the best resources for upholding of warranties... The last couple of years, DELL has been very popular, I myself prefer custom built computers, but I build them myself so thats not a good refrence :P... I hear a lot about dell. The other aspect you need to know, is that the new top of the line processors have been released, and its worth getting a computer that features it... Its called the Intel Core 2 Duo. Basically its the fastest thing you can get, and its cheaper than most. If you buy a new laptop with an intel core 2 duo, chances are you wont have or need to update your laptop for the next 10 years at least.   Here is a good one for you to look at getting. It is worth the cost. You can get one for less than 800. And dont be surprised, most laptops start at 1,000.

I don't know much of anything about Apple computers.  80 GB + hard drive and the highest RAM you can get is best for Gaming on most any computer. Usually the bigger the better.  Pentium or Celeron Processors are the best processors.  Most laptops only come equiped with trail spyware and virus protection, you'd have to check with you Internet Service Provider to see if virus protection is built in or download something (like Ad-Ware).  I personally would not do much file sharing or use limewire.  It's really risky even with good virus protection unless you know what you were doing and what to look for.  I suggest going to a computer store or a store that sells computers and talk with someone that knows about computers (most are really helpful)  Hope that helps you ^.^","www.ebay.com cruise the alienware lists in computer/networking. strengths, prices, etc","HP & Dell (and gateway and others) sell Windows based computers. It represents a majority of those sold.  Apple sells Mac primarily, it is a minority but a good system. It does not support many games nor apps that Windoes does.  As far a windows, bot Dell and HP have fairly comparable products, however, the service for assistance is skewed far in favor for HP in my opinion. I also find the HP machines a bit more robust. HP has many deals where a printer is thrown in and they have much better prnters than Dell.  See the web sites for prices and comparisons.. I'd go with HP","As far as performance and reliability, I vote for Dell. I just love 'em. And they have a pretty good price / payment plan, too!"

Apple used to buy their CPU from Motorola untill early 2006 when they signed a contract.  Now if your asking about the systems themselves in a whole, look at what your used to using.  Are you used to Windows or the Mac os?  If your an avid Windows user but don't learn fast don't get a Mac.  You'll get lost.  If you've been a Mac user all your life stick with Mac, though it will be more costly.  Macs are less suceptible to viruses, windows is more popular in the world.  Weigh the options.   Dell is cheaper (I will agree with the above comment).","Get a Dell, way cheaper, more software.","They're both Intel chips, but I would suggest going with the Apple- Apples tend to last much longer than PCs (PCs tend to last about 5 years or so, while I have a 16 year old Mac sitting in my room that still works), while Dell tends to use inferior parts (hence why they're so cheap).  I have a MacBook that I've owned for about three months now, and I've had no problems with it whatsoever.  Whatever you do, don't get a Dell- you'll end up with a paperweight in a few years.

Also, battery life is BAD with Toshiba.

I'm planning to buy a Sony Vaio when I'll have enough money.",WELL I HAVE A DELL LAB TOP AND IT SEEMS TO WORK FINE SO I DEFINETLY WOULD RECOMEND A DELL,I would not recommend Dell at all. From what I have read in Smart Computing Dell has about the worst tech support and computers ever. Though I can not recall all the stories or names of the people one story does stand out.  A woman bought a Dell laptop for about 900 and left it in her car one night. The computer froze and the screen cracked. Dell said that they would replace the screen for free. So she sent the computer off to Dell. Dell called back and told her that the computer would cost 960 dollars or so to fix. Not replace just fix the screen. The lady wrote Smart Computing and since they have more power than a regular person does and they cleared the issue up for the woman.  This is just one of the many Dell horror stories. Other stories include Dell promising to replace things with new parts only to put refurbished parts in the computer and then the parts burning out shortly after. Dell charging people for things they never bought or charging them for things that were covered under the warranty. The list goes on. Every month there is at least one letter of complaint about Dell in SC and they aren't the only company who consumers have problems with but they do seem to have the worst and most problems.  Personally I wouldn't go with any of the big name computer companies except for Apple. STOP! I know what you are thinking . 'I'm going to go buy an Apple.' Don't just yet. Apple makes a good solid computer BUT if you are not ready for a completely different operating system I do not recommend that you get an Apple. If I were out to buy a laptop I would find a friend who knows his or her computers and then have them help you through the part selection process over at http://www.ibuypower.com. They have a good selection of computers at a very nice price and do not practice those weird gimmicks that places like Dell do where they say you can get the computer for 'as low as xxx' but it turns out to be a good bit more than that because the base parts they use are sub-par technologies. But yeah that's just what I would do. The best thing is to read up on these companies and have that tech savvy friend help compare the 'bang for the buck' factor at all the different laptop manufacturers.,"If you plan to work on graphics software lie Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Corel Draw etc choose Mac systems. If you want to use a windows based operating sytstem use Toshiba. It guarantees best performance. HP laptops has Better graphics cards and good bundling and good pricing.

I only contact them when I know I have a hardware problem (they never help with software) and simply email, even though the auto-response messages are anonying, you can often push to get warrenty service/replacement. The other advantage of Dell is that it's such a standard laptop you can often find accessories on eBay (cheap batteries, etc) as well as get support from other Dell users (support.dell.com) Also I'd suggest signing up for the Dell newsletter, they always send out a weekly email with coupons or special deals. outlet.dell.com also has refurbished / returned computers which are still perfect at an even lower price.

If price is not an issue go for a centrino laptop (the CPU). I've got no issue with the manufacturer... all manufacturers have their fair share of production faults.  My best bet is to check for the following? * What specs does your work require (Specs = hardware specifications. Do you need a strong CPU with lots of ram... for programmers. Or something not so fast and small... for MS Office users) * What supplier will give you the best customer service. This is very important. If something goes wrong, you want to know wheter the supplier can fix the issue as quickly and cheaply as possible * Make/ Manufacturer - Pick the one that is known for its quality and service.  I currently own a Fujitsu Siemens and the laptop is really insane. 3.2P4 HT, 1GB Ram, 80GB Hd, but the manufacturer is not that great. Had quite a few problems with the thing...

None is better than the other.

Dell uses Intel process exclusively. IBM uses either Intel or AMD processors. Apple has its own processor.Neither Apple or AMD base their performance on old concept that the more Megahertz the processor had the better it was.  First Apple then AMD have proven that Megahertz alone is not a very good way to measure the computers performance.  Apple does not use the Windows operating system.  If you use to Windows then you will find Apple confusing.  It is my belief that the best computer is one which uses an AMD64 processor.  Recent reports are that the AMD is the number one desktop computer sold in the retail market for general home use.  And the best news is that a computer with an AMD processor is generally hundreds of dollars less expensive than one using Intel.  Performance testing in recent years have proved over and over that an AMD powered computer of say 2100 Megahurtz performs as well or in most cases better than an Intel powered computer operating at 3400 Megahertz.

IBM Sucks dont go near them, that is my opinion.

HP is awesome. I really like them. MY NUMBER ONE CHOICE!","Dell has pretty cruddy support no matter what they say. But they have great computers. IBM Sucks dont go near them, that is my opinion. HP is awesome. I really like them. MY NUMBER ONE CHOICE!","Let me repost my previous answer and it might help you:  Let me start by enumerating why you should not but these brands: 1.) HP/Compaq - does not have good quality control of parts from supplier like optical drives, TFT's etc. According to a supplier (I can not mention names), he said that he is pissed off with DELL because they reject 40 to 50% of his optical drives due to quality issues but happy with HP because he accepts them with a discount. I have two of this before an Armada M300 & HP Pavillion and sold them both after having so much problems and no help from stupid HP. Don't buy this. Offer this to your enemy. 2.) IBM - which is now LENOVO. I have so many customer complaints about IBM notebooks now. It seems it's not as good as the original thinkpad and getting replacement parts is very difficult. A Lenovo officer informed me that they have so many internal problems because the owners are concentrating on margins rather than customer satisfaction. Remember Lenovo bought IBM PC's & Laptops and they want to get their money back fast.  3.) ACER - This is a clone company trying hard to play in the branded market. This brand has been failing technical testing from large corporate customer. A lot of business establishments does not recognize this brand and wouldn't touch it with a ten foot pole. 4.) Toshiba - This is actually a good brand. Because they only concentrate on the portables. Known for their quality but a lot of times very pricy. Check for the nearest support center and the parts are a little bit hard to get hold of. 5.) Fujitsu - expensive Japanese made notebook but I honestly do not recommend it. 6.) Sony VAIO - Now this brand & model is very good but it's too rich for my blood. It's like buying a Porsche but a regular Ford is already OK for the same job. I had one of this before and I sold it. 7.) DELL - For me this is the best buy and good value for money. I've seen how DELL assembles and test their units and they are so bloody strict. If they find fault in one component they stop the assembly line (liking stopping the presses) remove the ssuspected batch problem and replace it with another batch and they could do that in less than 2 hours and test them again and again. Their back-end or support is fantastic. DELL was the first one who informed the world of the battery problem which they get from Sony. They have the website and replaced the battery fore free. Only after several months later other brands follow and finally admit it. I am so sorry but I started using DELL only May this year and it extremely good. I have torture tested it and never failed on me. Good luck and so sorry for the long comments.","Dell use propietary parts HP is moving away from that , but they do make cheap but pretty good computers, they are not feature filled IBM is the big iron, they no longer do small pcs"
dell,ibm,"What's  the best notebook brand and why? Dell, Sony Vaio, Apple, Toshiba, IBM, ... ? (in general comparison)","I have had a Toshiba Satellite A60 for 2 years now. I wouldn't buy a Toshiba laptop again. The colors on the display are very pale, although it doesn't have any dead pixels (yet). S Video TV out never worked properly, and it's DVD ROM decided to not read DVD's anymore about a week ago.

A firend of mine also has a Toshiba laptop (different model) and although the colors are brighter and DVD ROM still works, it heats up so bad that you can barely touch the touchpad.

Also, battery life is BAD with Toshiba.

I'm planning to buy a Sony Vaio when I'll have enough money.",WELL I HAVE A DELL LAB TOP AND IT SEEMS TO WORK FINE SO I DEFINETLY WOULD RECOMEND A DELL,I would not recommend Dell at all. From what I have read in Smart Computing Dell has about the worst tech support and computers ever. Though I can not recall all the stories or names of the people one story does stand out.  A woman bought a Dell laptop for about 900 and left it in her car one night. The computer froze and the screen cracked. Dell said that they would replace the screen for free. So she sent the computer off to Dell. Dell called back and told her that the computer would cost 960 dollars or so to fix. Not replace just fix the screen. The lady wrote Smart Computing and since they have more power than a regular person does and they cleared the issue up for the woman.  This is just one of the many Dell horror stories. Other stories include Dell promising to replace things with new parts only to put refurbished parts in the computer and then the parts burning out shortly after. Dell charging people for things they never bought or charging them for things that were covered under the warranty. The list goes on. Every month there is at least one letter of complaint about Dell in SC and they aren't the only company who consumers have problems with but they do seem to have the worst and most problems.  Personally I wouldn't go with any of the big name computer companies except for Apple. STOP! I know what you are thinking . 'I'm going to go buy an Apple.' Don't just yet. Apple makes a good solid computer BUT if you are not ready for a completely different operating system I do not recommend that you get an Apple. If I were out to buy a laptop I would find a friend who knows his or her computers and then have them help you through the part selection process over at http://www.ibuypower.com. They have a good selection of computers at a very nice price and do not practice those weird gimmicks that places like Dell do where they say you can get the computer for 'as low as xxx' but it turns out to be a good bit more than that because the base parts they use are sub-par technologies. But yeah that's just what I would do. The best thing is to read up on these companies and have that tech savvy friend help compare the 'bang for the buck' factor at all the different laptop manufacturers.,"If you plan to work on graphics software lie Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Corel Draw etc choose Mac systems. If you want to use a windows based operating sytstem use Toshiba. It guarantees best performance. HP laptops has Better graphics cards and good bundling and good pricing.  Incase you want to go for a good performer go for ASUS laptops. Nobody can beat them. Check also about the service points accessible.","I have had a Toshiba Satellite A60 for 2 years now.

basketball,football,Whats more popular in the Country Football or basketball?,football,"football, but in teh world soccer.","i think they both are of equal iin being popular--it just depends on the season. but i think basketball is more important because if you look at it, there are many colleges and universities with basketball teams and then there are some colleges and universities with no football teams. the university i attend has no football team and there are others across CA as well. at the same time, i think during basketball season, basketball becomes really popular and same for football",football

bmw,toyota,Which is better BMW M3 or TOYOTA SUPRA?,None,Bmw M3 2001 and up  otherwise I would go with the Supra,"Toyota Supra you can do alot more with it, and you wouldn't feel guilty modifying it unlike the M3, alot more tuning capabilities too.",Supra without a doubt The Toyota Supra is capable of reaching top speeds of 162 MPH. Many owners modify their Toyota Supra to achieve speeds in excess of 200 MPH Performance of the M3 is as follows (3.0l-24v I6) Euro Version - 210 kW/286 bhp 0-60 mph - 6.0 s. Top Speed: 155 mph / 250 km/h (electronically limited)  (3.0l-24v I6) U.S. Version - 177 kW/240 bhp 0-60 mph - 6.1 s.

Top Speed: 145 mph / 225 km/h (electronically limited),"If you want to drive your car, the BMW is by far the best choice. The Supra had a lot of repair issues; almost worse than a Ford and they always seemed to leave you stranded. I had an '83 Supra and it was fun but wouldn't win any drag races. The Supra is a good starter sports car, but the BMW is a serious ride. It will waste most cars on the road and do it with style. Remember, it's not all about dragging. You also have to be able to turn and to stop on a dime."

They get better gas mileage, less repairs over the years and they last much much longer.","If you intend to trade-in or sell that car you're going to buy in a few years time, then its Toyota.  If there's something in Sebring that you really like to keep for a long period and maintain it, then it's Chrysler.","Camry is more reliable, more resale value, and will probably be on the road years longer.... just my 2 cents worth.",I like chrysler because im a patriot of my country but i would put my money in toyota (more reliable),"I have a Camry and my daughter has a Dodge Avenger and for quality I would go with the Camry. It is better put together and performs good. Our Camry already has 190,000 miles on it and still going good. It is all about what you want from a car. The Camry isn't as slick as the Sebring.","Stick with the Toyota unless you have lots of sawdust on your garage floor to keep absorbing the oil leaks from Chrysler products. I've owned both and Toyota wins, hands-down !!!",Toyota is more costly for any repairs....car repairs in general are costly but foreign cars are more always,"go with toyota or honda, unless you want to know your auto mechanic by his first name. stay away from Chevy, Ford and Dodge.....they are a repair bill waiting to happen. toyota and honda still care about the quality of their vehicles. They run forever.","They are both very good cars I've owned both, I don't know about now but a few years ago Sebrings used Mitsubishi engines and the interior very similar to the Mitsubishi Eclipse as a matter of fact it had interchangeable parts with the Eclipse.  The Toyota is a very economical car, and yes very well built, but you have to take into consideration that Chrisler uses German technology from Mercedes, also very well built cars that are very reliable.  MPG's would probably be the deciding factor if it was me making the decision."

ford,nissan,"What is the best mini van..dodge,honda,nissan,or ford ??","I have to say first and foremost go with a Japanese engine--Honda, Toyota, or Nissan (in that order)  The Honda Odyssey is rated #1 by Consumer Reports and always gets great reviews by everyone else it is also rated #1 for resale value and it is can be very practical or you can choose to buy a more luxury version like the EX-L with or without DVD and/or Navigation.  I would recommend the Toyota if you are going to buy a used minivan cause they dont hold their value as well as Honda so u can really buy a nice fairly used one for a great price.  The Nissan Quest is kinda different and new looking and if thats something that appeals to you than great but I would definetly buy a new one just for the improved changes and the warranty for extra insurance.  I hope this helps-check out consumer reports and www.edmunds.com cause that will give you a TMV and let you know the cost to own over 1-5yrs and resale value as well as what others are paying for the same vehicle.","I have to say first and foremost go with a Japanese engine--Honda, Toyota, or Nissan (in that order)  The Honda Odyssey is rated #1 by Consumer Reports and always gets great reviews by everyone else it is also rated #1 for resale value and it is can be very practical or you can choose to buy a more luxury version like the EX-L with or without DVD and/or Navigation.

ford,nissan,If you could only  pick between a Nissan Altima or a ford escort which would u pick?,"I would say Nissan Altima. They are better cars. But I would not choose a car cause of being able to listen to music. What good is a car if your on the side of the road broke down listening to the stereo. Choose a car based on reliability, not the stereo system or the wheels it may have on it. Music is nice to hear while driving, but every once in awhile it is good to hear the engine to make sure it is not making noises that it should not be making. Driving takes responsibility for your desisions you make while driving and music should not be the main focus while in the car. Kinda got off the real topic, sorry. But anyways I would choose the Nissan. Good luck.","I would say Nissan Altima. They are better cars. But I would not choose a car cause of being able to listen to music.

Even though it is 2 years older. It is a better choice in the long run. Nissan is more RELIABLE than a Ford. Some people say that parts are hard to find and stuffs but thats not really true. Go to the local dealer, pick and pull, recycle center etc and you will find parts. As a matter of fact if you bought a ford then you need to worry more about parts because they are not that reliable. Also, later on if you decide to sell your Nissan, it will have a BETTER RESALE VALUE than a Ford. But in the end it is your decision....what is best for your needs....However, I would totally recommend a Nissan. Check out www.KBB.com to get the value of the car - that way you will know if the price is right. Also, I don't know why you are stating that the cd player will not fit...but check out www.crutchfield.com - online retailer of car audio - they can help you in getting it installed....",myslef i would never buy a forin car becuz parts r hard to fing and expensive and some nissan and ford cars and vans r the same,Get the Ford,A bicycle,Altima hand down...Fords suck!,Get the Nissan... hands down.,a Nissan altima...better car all around,"FORD, because they are Built Ford Tough, and Nissans suck.","The 95 Altima had a disgusting looking body style and a wimp of an engine but all in all if I HAD to choose between just those two I would go for the Altima.  After Ford or any other Detroit made car gets more than 40,000 miles on it you will be spending more than just the cost of a CD installation. If the Altima has less than 100K and has been well maintained then thats your car.","Nissan is the best, not only are they better with the engine but they have more technology and heaps more reliability!","ALTIMA, any year, hands down. It's just a better car by far.","Nissan Altima without a doubt, better performance and and better reliability, to admit it the 90's Ford Escorts did have a good reliability record but they were fairly sluggish (w/automatic transmission).","In each April issue, Consumer Reports lists repair histories of used cars and lists dependable used cars by their price range.

The suspension system is different between the two, but go with the F-150.  It still has lots of power, has the style, has the toughness, has the space & room needed, has the background of being a true truck!

Plus, the Titan is a new truck...it probably has a lot of things that can be improved for being a new model.  That's my opinion, but you have to make the decision on your own.  I say go Ford!

It'll take at least 5 decades for Ford to be their former glory. http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060421/ap_on_bi_ge/earns_ford_14"
ford,toyota,Does anyone notice the difference between this Ford site and Toyota site????,"Maybe you noticed how much longer Ford has been around? There are many classic Fords out on the road. When a car is 30 to 60 years old, it may need some repairs.

I won't drive nothing but a ford.,"Two different kind of owners.... Usually the Toyota owner will rather pay someone to work on it, even shadetree mechanics get scared of them because most people don't understand the differences between them Most American car owners are more likely I find to be Do-It yourselfers also. Biggest thing is on the imports.. Yes they will usually go more miles before they break down but when they do the repair bill makes people get rid of them quick  My think is, if they didn't break, why do they have so many specialty import shops and mechanics at the dealerships?",If they are old they have problems yes. Newer ford break down because of stupid people. Ive had all types of cars. Fords been the best for me. I use to have lots of problems with cars until I started keeping up with maintenance and repairs. I have a 86 mustang runs awesome for the last year ive own it. High miles and it sat for 2 years before i bought it. I did the imports and thought my car was fast. With a header and exuast done on it. Had it towed 3 times for stupid shit. My mustang is awesome. dont run the ac unit and air pump with the belt. put cheapo headers and after market exuast on it with KandN filter. It hauls butt. Love it.

Lexus may be too expensive (they're basically a Toyota...ex. In Japan, there is no such car as Lexus, only Toyota).  Hondas and Toyotas are both reliable, offer hybrid cars and if you don't even get a hybrid, they still have great gas mileage.  They are both reliable and you can just change the oil every 5-6,000 miles (I've done it before).",Ford,"Well, it depends on how much money you have to spend! A Lexus would be best!  Toyota and Honda are excellent, but choose a small car for parallel parking and those darn hills!  Consumer Reports very rarely recommends Fords."
ford,toyota,What is your opinion on GM vs. Toyota vs. Ford??,"I would go to kbb.com and consumer reports to answer this.  However, my opinion is that Saturn is the only American car maker that likely won't leave you on the side of the road one day.  I can say never buy Dodge as someone above stated, stay away from Plymouth, certain Fords, GMs, and Chryslers.  Buicks are the cheapest to insure, but also kinda suck in looks. For a good car that will be comfortable and reliable, stick to the best 3 Honda, Toyota, and Nissan.  With the Nissan I'd stay away from the Sentra and Xterra.  You can also add Infiniti and Acura to the list of great running ans comfortable cars.  Now, I would buy BMW, Mercedes, VW, Audi, Volvo, and Cadillac only if I were pretty well paid and didn't mind doing the mandatory maintenance.  Some times when these things have problems, they are very expensive to fix.  Lastly you have your Kia and Hyundai.  I would buy these before most American vehicles, but not without that 100,000 mile warranty.","I would go to kbb.com and consumer reports to answer this.

The american cars aren't built to last, they're build to be repurchased in 5-6 years",I think for the most part thanks to Toyota and Honda that the Ford and Gm products are just as reliable as their comparable foreign named vehicles. This wasn't the case twenty years ago but US manufacturers have caught up.,"I've owned numerous GM products and I feel they are built as well as Toyota and Ford products.  One of my current cars is a 1995 Pontiac Grand AM that I bought new.  It has over 150,00 miles on it and never gave me any trouble. All I've ever needed to do was the routine scheduled maintenance.  The car does not use a drop of oil between oil changes. I strongly feel that the idea that foreign cars are built better is a total myth.","Fords are great as long as they are running.

Stay away from Dodge, though, trust me.",stop answering my questions,"I've always been a GM girl but I just traded in an '04 GMC Sierra for a Dodge. I bought the GM brand new and within a month I had issues with the tranny.. had to have that replaced. The next thing that went was the motors for the windows... those were replaced. CD player suddenly dies on me ('We don't guarntee anything if you're playing CDs you made.' 'Dude! This was a brand new CD fresh out of the package!') Finally got that replaced when I reminded them that I had a bumper to bumper warranty. Last thing before I traded it in was the mystery cluster (I mean the instrument cluster). I'm in the middle of nowhere (I-80 in Wyoming) and suddenly I have no clue how fast I'm going. Within an hour, my oil gauge went out followed every other gauge. I get to the next town (well, it was a gas station and mini mart so I guess in Wyoming that qualifies as a town), turned off the engine, checked all the fuses and what wires I could easily get to... everything's good. My bf's company uses Chev's and they also have several '04s. Apparently they'd had the same issue. So... finally get to where there's a GM dealership and come to find out the clusters are on back order because they've been having a lot of them go out (thank you, GM for notifying the vehicle owners!). So, even tho' I've never owned anything but GM vehilce until February when I bought the Dodge, at this point, I just can't recommend them in good faith. I did, out of loyalty, go and test drive several GM products when I decided to get rid of the truck but that's a whole different set of gripes!","Toyota's are some of the best cars out there (Toyota makes Lexus). But they are also the most expensive. It really depends on what TYPE of vehicle you are looking for. Toyota trucks are really dependable and last a long time with little maintenance. My husband and I have two Chevy Trucks, which we love as well. My sister has Fords, which she really likes. So i think it is personal preference. But don't buy a Dodge, they are pieces of crap. Every Dodge we ever owned would overheat or have engine/transmission problems."

nissan,toyota,2007 Toyota 4Runner vs 2007 Nissan Pathfinder?,"Either is smart choice.  Nissans as of late have had some quality issues.  The Titan, Armada and Quests have been disappointments as far as repair frequency goes.  Not sure on the Pathfinder.  I know the 4Runner's had some problems initially with the 4.0 V6's, but that was early in production 2005 models. 

I would do the 4Runner.  Toyota quality and reliability.  You may well have a problem finding one that is not loaded.  And do you really need 4x4 (A 4x2 looks similar and will cost about $2000 less)?  These vehicles are also truck based SUV's, and the growing trend nowadays is car based SUV's (RAV4, Murano, Highlander, Pilot).  You give up some off road ability and they do look a bit more soccer mom-ish, but you get better mileage, ride and handling.  I would avoid Explorers, Nitros and Trailblazers.  They depreciate rapidly and just are not as well made.","Either is smart choice.  Nissans as of late have had some quality issues.

google,microsoft,Yahoo or Microsoft or Google?,"Firstly, I think that all three are very good. At the moment my choice would be Yahoo.

Google's great selling point was its search engine with the complex algorithm that tended to produce relevant answers. At one stage that seemed to work well, but lately I find that any question that I ask gets bogged down with commercial sites. 

When I search a topic I don't want to know what the same 40 web retailers want me to know about an iPod or a Pioneer CDJ1000, I want to know stuff that they DON'T want me to know.

Of course this will be tricky for any search engine. Commercial sites will make a business to come top of the pile somehow.

Yahoo's answer to this seems to be to deliver content from people. They are doing this by empowering tools like delicious and my web, through Yahoo answers and Yahoo groups. ""The social internet"" as some people call it.

I think in the long run this will pay dividends.

MSN has exceptional web content properties. Things like WebMD and Encarta deliver great information on many topics without having to trawl through gibberish about collidal silver and jojoba oil. It gets stuck though if you want info on something like a Pioneer CDJ1000, I doubt that MSN will ever have content on that.

Yahoo could really really do with something like Encarta or Wikipedia. That's a gaping hole in its property.

Google seems to have recognised the problems with its model and is trying to make revenue through being an ""always-on"" store of information through things like GMail and storing all your data on a remote server.

I think the privacy isssues to do with this will be resolved eventually and I think it is A Good Thing.

Yahoo are hot on their trail though, as is Microsoft. Their mail services have been upgraded vastly and I think at the moment at least, Yahoo is ahead of GMail. 

I doubt this is going to be a lasting point of advantage for Google.

Kudos to Google though for taking user privacy seriously in rejecting to disclose user information when asked recently.

The PS2 has a massive library of games, most of them very cheap by now.  The PS2 itself should also be pretty cheap,  If you don't have to have the very newest in consoles, the PS2 is a good buy. The PS3 is capable of playing PSX and PS2 titles, so you may want to save up your cash for a PS3.  However, it will be a whopping $500 or $600, and you'll need a $15 adaptor for PS2 and PSX memory cards, so unless you've got money to burn, you might want to just spring for the PS2. The PSP does a lot of things aside from playing games (allows you to surf the net with a wifi connection, lets you play mp3s and movies you've converted to the right format, lets you watch UMD movies), but it all comes at a price.  The PSP itself is pretty expensive, and the game lineup so far has not been very impressive.  The games are mostly PS2 ports, but they don't control as well due to the absence of a second analog stick.  As a movie player it's pretty nice, but the UMD movie format is failing and is already discontinued at many stores (mainly because they cost more than DVDs and can only be played on the PSP).  Finally, if you want to really use it as a movie or music player, you'll need to get the $250 bundle--which comes with a 1 gig memory stick--or buy one yourself (the 1 gig model is $70 alone and seems to be the best choice). Basically, the PSP is a sleek toy but it's not gotten the kind of support it needs to justify the purchase for most people, considering the price.","psp, it is like a portable ipod, movie player and portable ps2 all in one, plus you can view your photos on it and use the internet wirlessly at wifi points.

The PSP is actually not much different from the PS2 in terms of power and graphics but instead of running from DVD's it runs on UMD's which are small circular/flat stylebits of plastic. The big bummer with the PSP is you cant plug it into a tv so you're forced into playing on a tiny screen. Well, you can plug it in a tv but only if you do it via a PS3 which seems a rip off to me. So overall, a PS2 is much better if you just want games in the house but if you're on the move then go for the PSP :-)",ps2   there are more games out for it and it still plays dvds,PS2 bar far!!,"actually it is just the same,but for me it is good to have psp because it is portable you can bring it anywhere!!! hope you like my answer!!"

Although, you can download and run 'homebrew' games which require version 1.5 OS version 3) No google talk or messenger yet (on PS2 or PSP) 4) PS2 can have a USB keyboard.  PSP has a really horrible on-screen keyboard (like a telephone) The graphics on the PSP are awesome for a portable, but the PS2 is far far better.  But, obviously, you can't easily cart around a PS2.  So, for that reason, the PSP is definitely a better device for portability. You can browse the web on the PSP, but so far there are no easy chat systems for the browser.  There are chat systems built into some games, though.

You can watch videos and movies, and they look great. You can download lots of stuff from the internet. Music, games, video clips.  Quickest and most secure way is to use the USB cable to connect the PSP to your computer and connect to internet that way for downloads. But PSP comes with a browser installed, so right out of the box you can go to a hot spot and surf the web.  Typing text is a little clunky, since you have to use the game controls to move around to select letters, but you get used to it. No worse than text messaging from a phone.","The PSP and PS2 are about equal in power.

coca-cola,pepsi,What is better: Coca-Cola or Pepsi?,"Interesting theory, but I have an issue with your Proposed ""experiment"". If you put a metal object in a glass of COKE for 5 days, what in the world would this prove about Coke doing anything to peoples insides??

First..your analogy is poor. People's stomach linings are made of soft tissue, not metal. Therefore, the damage coke can do to metal says ABSOLUTELY NOTHING about what Coke does to Tissues.

Next, Coke probably stays in contact with any area of a persons stomach, intestines, ect for only brief periods of time. You are placing non-moving metal objects in Coke for 5 DAYS!!. Once again, there is no valid comparison.

Perhaps take a peach. Place one half in some sort of mildly acidic solution such as vinegar and water. 

Next, take the other half. Place it in the same solution, mixed with a glass of COKE, Diet Coke..for 1/2 an hour.

Is the Peach in the Coke solution rotted away after 1/2 an hour??? If so, it would lend a hell of a lot more credibility to your theory!!!! You could say, well a peach made of soft tissues completely rotted away into nothing when exposed to a glass of COKE for 1/2 an hour. Your stomach lining, similar to a peach, would  be exposed to a glass of coke for roughly the same period of time....therefore look at the likelihood that Coke does
substantial damage to our stomach linings.

Coke by the way, more likely does a hell of a lot more damage to: causing obesity, and rotting teeth due to the sugar content.","Interesting theory, but I have an issue with your Proposed 'experiment'.

When my husband was stationed in Turkey, they were out of Pepsi at the commissary and I thought I'd die.  I bought Sunkist Orange and drank that while living there.

If we speak about health, Pepsi and Coca-Cola aren't good at all !!","This is why I like PEPSI better than COKE  Let's start with the history. Coke started out with cocaine in it, hence the name Coke. That's not cool. I like my soft drinks to be 100% drug-free. I've heard of dying thirst, but not dying while quenching thirst ! Secondly, Coke is just plain 'evil'. In undergrad, during lunch I've had a soda from the soda machine once in a while. Never had any problems with Pepsi, but once I had to get a Coke (I guess Pepsi was out at that time), I got the soda, went back to my table and gently set it down. A few minutes later, I twisted the cap, and the thing exploded. That's not cool either ! Not at all ! Another time when I bought a Coke, I set it down on the table. A few minutes later, completely by itself, the bottle fell over, breaking the cap, and the thing exploded again. A friend of mine used to work in a store and Pepsi outsold Coke about 6 to 1. She even said that the Pepsi delivery guys are much cooler than the guys from Coke. Moreover, Pepsi's blue is a much better color than Coke's silly red. I feel fortunate to come from the largest archipelago in the world, Indonesia, where people like Pepsi more than Coke. Still pisses me off that Indonesia is a safe heaven for terrorists, but at least the people know their sodas.    written by: Alvin Barlian Saturday, Sept 13, 2003, 5.30 AM -couldn't sleep-",Diet Vanilla coke,"PEPSI!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

coca-cola,pepsi,What's the difference in ingredients between Coca-Cola and Pepsi?,"Coca-cola has more of a bite in the taste.  Did you know that Coca-cola changed it's taste to match that if Pepsi?  They changed it back in 2000, though which was also their 100th year anniversary.  Pretty good marketing ploy, eh?

cnn,fox,"Which is more objective, CNN or FOX news?",I would say the most neutral would C-Span or the BBC.  As far as CNN and FOX.. I think CNN leans less to the left than FOX leans to the right.,I would say the most neutral would C-Span or the BBC.  As far as CNN and FOX.. I think CNN leans less to the left than FOX leans to the right.,"In a large case this likely depends upon the issue being covered. The first thing to understand is that there is no such thing as total objectivity. Every person brings subjectivity into the process even if they try not to, simply because they are human. What we pay attention to is likely unconcious, but this alone makes the process subjective. If this is true, then the best control against this is a good editing team. Unfortunately I do not know enough about this to know the truth. My guess is however that the level of involvement of ownership/management into the editorial process will decrease the freedom of the editors to work well. My second assumption is that a company doing well is one in which management is less likely want to meddle with for fear of killing the cash cow. In this case, I would have to say Fox over CNN.",Amnesty international,"CNN Even while it was called the Clinton News Network, it's generally accepted that Fox has a strong conservative lean.","It is a matter of opinion.  If you are conservative, you think FOX is unbiased and CNN leans to the left.  A liberal would feel the opposite.","Neither.  They both lean in a specific direction.  I consider CNN and FOX to be polar opposites.  In my opinion, there is no completely objective news source.","It all depends on your personal reference point now doesn't it? Both are great to watch and listen to, and as a added bonus, you have the click button remote along with your mind to determine if the objectives fit your profile.

cnn,fox,Fox News or CNN News?? Which is more acurate?,Fox! Bill O'Rielly!,"CNN Fox is more distorted towards republican propaganda. CNN can be bias, but it doesnt quite compare to how aggressive FOX bias is. However, due to this same fact, fox is just more entertaining, spouting MTV style 4-second-per-image switches along with flashy lights and lot of american flags. Notice that the people who voted for fox: of the 3, 2 have posted the same question more than once, the other asks 'What do i ask?' as a question. JW is a high school student. I think its consistent with more educated people understanding that FOX is horribly Bias rather than get sucked in by the mtv style entertainment.  Fox Motto: 'You disgrace our troops by questioning our government.",Fox News,Fox,FOX News is the most accurate and precise in my opinion.,"FOX NEWS, owned by media god Rupert Murdoch is 'fair and balanced",Fox! Bill O'Rielly!,"CNN is much more accurate.  Instead of focusing on journalism, Fox (run by former Nixon and Reagan staffer Roger Ailes) fills more of its air time with conservative commentators. A good news source shouldn't be trying to convince you of its position.  It shouldn't have a position.",I would have to say Fox because that is the one that my parents always watch so lol i guess that is the best one!,"CNN.

CNN i would say, is still better than CBS or NBC.","I watch Fox, CBC, and sometimes NBC.  Yes I know Fox is Conservative with the other to liberal but this way I get a mix.  BBC is anti Jewish so I shy away form them.  I refuse to watch CNN, to me the cnn stands for criminal news network, mostly now because they were elated when they showed a soldier being killed by a sniper! As far as Bill O'Reily he does make his points and will have anyone on his show. Whether they agree with him or not.","The BBC is better than both, but if you had to choose between the 2, go with CNN.   FOX is comple bull**** and has a political agenda.","As non-American (yaya, I know...) I would recommend BBCworld. It's pretty impartial and a good way to get an objective point of view. If BBCworld is not possible, I'd prefer CNN to FOX, because, just for example, FOX doesn't even show the newest polls for Nov 7 on their homepage, as these aren't in favour of the GOP. I think that says everything.  It's hard to say, but when CNN shows that mentioned video, that doesn't mean they work against American soldiers but they show the reality. At least sometimes.  To be honest, I'd try to watch all of these and to read news from foreign news stations (newspapers and TV-networks...), that'll give you a broader perspective and after a while you can decide which you like most. Because it's absolutely on you!",What Borat said.  I refuse to watch Fox and Dildo Reilly sucks (ambiguous pun intended).,"TV news is corporate, slanted, incomplete and hypnotic.

What amazes me is that people can believe the Fox News isn't biased, what with Bill O'Reilly, Hannity and its other newscasts. Maybe they just believe it's not biased because it says it's 'fair and balanced.'  Actually, if you want news, your average daily newspaper has more information in it than either of these broadcasts.

If you don't mind paying a little more go with the name brand for the extra peace of mind.

But I'd never say they have great technical support. Talking to a person in India who hardly speaks english and is only trained to deal with the most basic problems never makes the frustration of a broken computer easier to deal with. I only contact them when I know I have a hardware problem (they never help with software) and simply email, even though the auto-response messages are anonying, you can often push to get warrenty service/replacement. The other advantage of Dell is that it's such a standard laptop you can often find accessories on eBay (cheap batteries, etc) as well as get support from other Dell users (support.dell.com) Also I'd suggest signing up for the Dell newsletter, they always send out a weekly email with coupons or special deals. outlet.dell.com also has refurbished / returned computers which are still perfect at an even lower price.

If price is not an issue go for a centrino laptop (the CPU). I've got no issue with the manufacturer... all manufacturers have their fair share of production faults.  My best bet is to check for the following? * What specs does your work require (Specs = hardware specifications. Do you need a strong CPU with lots of ram... for programmers. Or something not so fast and small... for MS Office users) * What supplier will give you the best customer service. This is very important. If something goes wrong, you want to know wheter the supplier can fix the issue as quickly and cheaply as possible * Make/ Manufacturer - Pick the one that is known for its quality and service.  I currently own a Fujitsu Siemens and the laptop is really insane. 3.2P4 HT, 1GB Ram, 80GB Hd, but the manufacturer is not that great. Had quite a few problems with the thing...

dell,sony,Which one is better Sony laptop or Dell laptop for students?,"Having worked with both, here's my view on this.

Dell notebooks are generally better, but less 'feature rich'.  The reason I find them better is that they have better support and better debugging/repair tools.... and with Windows, you need all the help you can get!

If there's a Windows problem.. and there will be, Sony notebooks require complete formatting and reinstalling the entire OS from scratch because they do not ship with standard Windows media (only a full recovery CD set).  So, you can't simply grab the Windows media and run a standard repair first.  I just don't relish the thought of having to backup my data, wipe the hard drive and completely reinstall and recover everything.  Can you say time consuming, not to mention all the hassles?

I don't know your price range, but I'm looking into asking for the Toshiba Satellite =)","Having worked with both, here's my view on this. Dell notebooks are generally better, but less 'feature rich'.  The reason I find them better is that they have better support and better debugging/repair tools.... and with Windows, you need all the help you can get! If there's a Windows problem.. and there will be, Sony notebooks require complete formatting and reinstalling the entire OS from scratch because they do not ship with standard Windows media (only a full recovery CD set).  So, you can't simply grab the Windows media and run a standard repair first.

HP/Compaq have actually improved their product in recent years and their support is similar to that of Dell and Sony (usually across the ocean), but their product is pretty good. And Dell as always is producing a good quality product. What should determine what you get, anyone of these manufacturers could work best depending on your criteria.

The low power models also get great battery life. You will pay a premium for the Sony which may not be proportional to the increase in quality. As for Apple. If you get the iBook G4 you will only be able to run Apple software. If you can move up a bit in price you can get the Macbook Pro starting at $1999 or less if you can get the student or government discount. The Macbook pro will also let you install Windows XP using Boot Camp.

From what I have read in Smart Computing Dell has about the worst tech support and computers ever. Though I can not recall all the stories or names of the people one story does stand out.  A woman bought a Dell laptop for about 900 and left it in her car one night. The computer froze and the screen cracked. Dell said that they would replace the screen for free. So she sent the computer off to Dell. Dell called back and told her that the computer would cost 960 dollars or so to fix. Not replace just fix the screen. The lady wrote Smart Computing and since they have more power than a regular person does and they cleared the issue up for the woman.  This is just one of the many Dell horror stories. Other stories include Dell promising to replace things with new parts only to put refurbished parts in the computer and then the parts burning out shortly after. Dell charging people for things they never bought or charging them for things that were covered under the warranty. The list goes on. Every month there is at least one letter of complaint about Dell in SC and they aren't the only company who consumers have problems with but they do seem to have the worst and most problems.  Personally I wouldn't go with any of the big name computer companies except for Apple. STOP! I know what you are thinking . 'I'm going to go buy an Apple.' Don't just yet. Apple makes a good solid computer BUT if you are not ready for a completely different operating system I do not recommend that you get an Apple. If I were out to buy a laptop I would find a friend who knows his or her computers and then have them help you through the part selection process over at http://www.ibuypower.com. They have a good selection of computers at a very nice price and do not practice those weird gimmicks that places like Dell do where they say you can get the computer for 'as low as xxx' but it turns out to be a good bit more than that because the base parts they use are sub-par technologies. But yeah that's just what I would do. The best thing is to read up on these companies and have that tech savvy friend help compare the 'bang for the buck' factor at all the different laptop manufacturers.,"If you plan to work on graphics software lie Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Corel Draw etc choose Mac systems. If you want to use a windows based operating sytstem use Toshiba. It guarantees best performance. HP laptops has Better graphics cards and good bundling and good pricing.

Windows hosting companies usually offer Access or SQL Server, but not MySQL.  If you want to work with MySQL, the best choice is PHP.  There are a lot of hosting companies that provide PHP/MySQL hosting (usually, on Linux or FreeBSD), so hosting is extremely inexpensive. Building high-performance Web applications with Java and MySQL can be problematic.  On the one hand, there are known performance issues with MySQL's JDBC drivers.  On the other hand, most companies offering JSP hosting use Apache Tomcat for runtime environment, which may lead to another group of performance issues.  Friendster, for example, tried to build a social networking site on JSP/Tomcat/MySQL, but ended up throwing away their JSP front-end and replacing it with one written in PHP.  Since then, the number of their users has more than tripled, while performance complaints dropped sharply.  As a practical matter, most of large JSP sites run their front-end in runtime environments other than Tomcat (JBOSS, PowerTier, WebLogic, WebSphere), and their back-end, on Oracle..."

I do like football but its a lot easier to manage you only have to check your team once a week to do good.","I like the baseball much better. It's more interactive as it's usually done daily, and most players are eligible at many positions, unlike football.","football by a mile.  you don't have to pay attention to it every single day, every real-life game is truly meaningful, and the scoring makes a lot more sense. (i don't use yahoo fantasy football.)","Baseball by far.  Football particularly with Yahoo's default settings is too luck based because of the value of touchdowns.  Some stiff backup can catch a one yard pass and outscore a RB or receiver who gain 119 yds without scoring.

If you are looking for a game that you do not have to pay attention to realize what is going on then the answer is FOOTBALL. if you are looking for a sport that true fans pay attention to then it is baseball. In baseball the true baseball fans can tell you what happens inning by inning like a story, but for some reason the football fans die hard or not tell you what happened on every play.

However, I am glad someone pointed out that football (as a global context) is the most popular sport in the world.  For all fellow Americans, we go by soccer. That is truly a more popular game.  Played in every country. If you want to talk about American Football, again it is strictly American.  Even though Baseball is America's pastime, it is already infinitely more popular and more global because of the World Baseball Classic.  No other country plays American Football.  If some idiot wants to bring up the basically all-American-NFL-Europe-minor-league-teams-for-the-regular-NFL, then what I can say?   Baseball EASILY has the highest attendance annually, more than the NFL, NBA and NHL combined.  I know guys...they play 162 games (get the number right), but they are able to average over 30,000 for each game.  That is an extremely hard task.  Furthermore, the second most attended league in the world is...what else...the Japanese Baseball league (NPB).  Again, Soccer is the most popular sport in the world, but in personal attendance, its Baseball.  Additionally, since baseball is played professionally in many nations (Korea, Japan, U.S., Canada, Mexico etc.), the answer is blatantly Baseball over American Football which is restricted to the 50 states, rather than the world."

motorola,samsung,"which brand of mobile phone do you think is the best - nokia, motorola, samsung, etc??..?","Well this is not an easy question to answer. Never the less it is a pretty good question and an interesting one too.

Let's analyze. Companies like Samsung, LG etc are basically consumer electronics companies. Their product line ranges from TVs to DVD players on one side and mobile phone to CD/DVD writers on the other. They also assemble PCs and manufacture LCD/Plasma screens. For example, a company like LG focuses most of its attention (and resources) to LCD screens and Plasma TVs as it is a high profit business. For them mobile phone is an instrument to complete their product line.

On the other hand, companies like Nokia and Motorola are pure communication companies. They are the ones that develop new technologies like Bluetooth, MMS etc. Since their core activity (and their means of earning their bread and butter) is wireless communication, their mobile phones will always be most customer friendly. Moreover, their after sales service would also be comparatively better to companies like Samsung, LG etc.

However, the choice of a mobile phone is very personal and individualistic. Therefore, one will have to look at what one needs to buy rather than what the companies want to sell. The above analysis would help him or her to make a wise decision.","Well this is not an easy question to answer. Never the less it is a pretty good question and an interesting one too. Let's analyze.

This phone was a great start for the new wave of nokia phones the 3G series.it supports symbian OS & JAVA.It has a great performance & speed. & You can install almost all symbian & Java programs & games on it.one bad thing about this phone is that you can't make your own picture messages but still you can forward the picture messages that other people sent you.The camera works great but the night mode -like the other Nokia phones- is still weak. GPRS & Data movement speed is good.the in-phone storage is only 10 MBs but you can add up to 1 GB of memory card storage to it.

motorola,nokia,"which brand of mobile phone do you think is the best - nokia, motorola, samsung, etc??..?","Well this is not an easy question to answer. Never the less it is a pretty good question and an interesting one too.

Let's analyze. Companies like Samsung, LG etc are basically consumer electronics companies. Their product line ranges from TVs to DVD players on one side and mobile phone to CD/DVD writers on the other. They also assemble PCs and manufacture LCD/Plasma screens. For example, a company like LG focuses most of its attention (and resources) to LCD screens and Plasma TVs as it is a high profit business. For them mobile phone is an instrument to complete their product line.

On the other hand, companies like Nokia and Motorola are pure communication companies. They are the ones that develop new technologies like Bluetooth, MMS etc. Since their core activity (and their means of earning their bread and butter) is wireless communication, their mobile phones will always be most customer friendly. Moreover, their after sales service would also be comparatively better to companies like Samsung, LG etc.

However, the choice of a mobile phone is very personal and individualistic. Therefore, one will have to look at what one needs to buy rather than what the companies want to sell. The above analysis would help him or her to make a wise decision.","Well this is not an easy question to answer. Never the less it is a pretty good question and an interesting one too. Let's analyze.

php,ruby,"Can someone tell me the major differences between MySQL/PHP, RubyonRails, LAMP, and ASP.net?","PHP/MySQL is often embedded in HTML.  It's fairly easy to learn and there is a lot of free scripts online that you can use on your own web site.  A good way to learn PHP/MySQL is to install a content management system like WordPress and then tweak the code to make it do what you want.  w3schools.com has some PHP tutorials, and also use the search engines to find PHP tutorials.  PHP.net is a good reference also.  For example to find out how to send email with PHP, just type php.net/mail into your browser.  To learn how to format the date, type php.net/date.

LAMP stands for Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP.  They are made to work well together.  You can use a Linux distro on your own computer (like Ubuntu) and test your PHP/MySQL scripts on your own computer.  That is one of the best ways to learn.  Most web sites are hosted on Linux and LAMP is very popular.  Using it at home is a good learning experience.

If you have Windows and want to use PHP/MySQL, download Apache2triad and it will install what you need on your computer.

ASP.NET is for pratical purposes Microsoft-only.  I don't recommend it because it is more expensive.  You would probably need to buy software for it (Visual Studio) and the hosting is more expensive.  There are many more free scripts for PHP/MySQL than for ASP.NET as far as I know. 

RubyOnRails is excellent.  Ruby is easy to learn.  ROR is a bit harder unless you know some programming.  There are a few good books out on Ruby and ROR in the Pragmatic Programmers series.

For e-commerce, why not try Drupal?  It is a free content management system written in PHP/MySQL.  It has ecommerce features.  You can take a look at my site for an example -- it is basically a default installation with a few modules.  My theme is barely modified from the original, but it is highly customizable if you put some time into it.","PHP/MySQL is often embedded in HTML.

There are a few good books out on Ruby and ROR in the Pragmatic Programmers series. For e-commerce, why not try Drupal?  It is a free content management system written in PHP/MySQL.  It has ecommerce features.  You can take a look at my site for an example -- it is basically a default installation with a few modules.

ford,honda,"Between a Honda Civic, Mazda3, Ford Focus, and Scion tc, what should I buy? Any other suggestions?","Stay away from the Focus for all that is good in this world, stay away from the Focus.  That being said, the Mazda3 shares many of the same components as the Focus but is tuned slightly better and is almost as good as the European Focus which is by all counts a fine car, the US version sucks.  I think that Honda tends to overprice the Civic so I wouldn't get it either plus people like stealing the airbags out of them by breaking into the car through the rear window.

So, I would lean towards the Mazda3 but in addition to it you should check out the Saturn Ion 2 or 3 (but not the Ion 1).  My dad has an Ion 3 and it's a great car.  Electric power steering (which is more responsive than hydraulic steering, you could steer the car with your pinkie finger if you wanted), the battery is contained in the trunk thereby reducing heat exposure and giving you longer battery life and then it has the dent resistant plastic body panels, I like the Saturn Ion also, so much so that it will be my next car.

One more word of wisdom, stay away from Nissan I had a bad experience with the car that I am not willing to forgive any time soon.  A problem with the ECM and fuel pump took a month to fix (but I could still drive the car) and then I was rear ended by an overzealous truck driver who went on to hit four more cars.  That took five weeks in the shop to get all the parts from Nissan thanks to their just in time part system.  Saturn on the other hand has most parts on hand at the factory so repairs won't take nearly as long.","Stay away from the Focus for all that is good in this world, stay away from the Focus.

Resale value on the Focus is pretty awful, though, so if you plan on unloading it anytime in the next 3 years, you're going to end up losing money vs the Scion of the Civic.  I haven't driven the Mazda so cannot comment on it. The tC is really a different car than the other 3, much sportier (faster), a lower seat, and less backseat than the others.  If you are into that sort of thing, go for the tC and enjoy!","The Focus is your best choice here. Inexpensive up front, and will continue to be less expensive in the long run (insurance and maintenance). A Focus is a Focus no matter where it's from, so don't be afraid of someone else's bad experience (most likeley from lack of mainteneace). The Focus be maintained inexpensively, and there are Ford dealerships everywhere. The 3 is similar to the Ford, but why buy the 3 which costs so much more? Your other choices are too mainstream and definitely too expensive for what you get.","For the long term, I would probably select the Civic for its practicality. Plus you can get the Hybrid. But a used Focus is always inexpensive and easy to operate. It's a hard choice. I would drive all 4 and see which one is your favorite.",Scion has a cool new body style and seems dependable.

I would recommend the Toyota if you are going to buy a used minivan cause they dont hold their value as well as Honda so u can really buy a nice fairly used one for a great price.  The Nissan Quest is kinda different and new looking and if thats something that appeals to you than great but I would definetly buy a new one just for the improved changes and the warranty for extra insurance.  I hope this helps-check out consumer reports and www.edmunds.com cause that will give you a TMV and let you know the cost to own over 1-5yrs and resale value as well as what others are paying for the same vehicle.","I have to say first and foremost go with a Japanese engine--Honda, Toyota, or Nissan (in that order)  The Honda Odyssey is rated #1 by Consumer Reports and always gets great reviews by everyone else it is also rated #1 for resale value and it is can be very practical or you can choose to buy a more luxury version like the EX-L with or without DVD and/or Navigation.

FORD IS GETTING RID OF THERE MINI VAN LINE UP ALL TOGETHER BECAUSE OF SUCH LOW SALES AND MANY MANY PROBLEMS. NOW NISSAN MAKES GREAT VEHICLES ALL AROUND BUT FOR SOME WEIRD TWISTED REASON, THEIR MINI VANS HAVE FALLEN APPART AND NISSAN IS EXPERIENCING MANY PROBLES WITH RELIABILITY WITH THEIR MINI VAN LINE UP.   HONDA HAS BEEN THE FLAG SHIP AND THE LEADER IN THE MINI VAN WARS FOR MANY MANY YEARS. GREAT  CONFORT WELL THOUGHT OUT, AND FAIRLY GOOD TO GREAT RELIABILITY. BUT THIS LAST YEAR OR TWO TOYOTA HAS REALLY PROVEN TO BE A LEADER AND HAVE THE BEST RELIABILITY CONFORT AND RESALE VALUE. SO EITHER HONDA OR TOYOTA IS THE WAY TO GO.

Lexus may be too expensive (they're basically a Toyota...ex. In Japan, there is no such car as Lexus, only Toyota).  Hondas and Toyotas are both reliable, offer hybrid cars and if you don't even get a hybrid, they still have great gas mileage.  They are both reliable and you can just change the oil every 5-6,000 miles (I've done it before).",Ford,"Well, it depends on how much money you have to spend! A Lexus would be best!

I am not much for Fords; seems they were always breaking down on me, but then again, I never bought one new, so that could be the issue.",well personally i think it all depends on the engine itself i work for ford and i can tell you that the zetec engines they put in the zx2 is without question far more superior than the spi they put in them before.

Bigger engine, a tad more torque, though a little heavier. I like they way the look better. I don't like Japanese interiors.

ford,honda,Which is BEST... Honda s2000 or Ford Focus ST?,"Seems to be some misguided response here.  The Ford is not the rusting hulk of rubbish that people seem to think it is.  In the UK the reliability index actually puts the Focus as being more reliable than a  VW Golf, by quite a margin no less.

Totally different engine charachterisitcs, Focus' Volvo Sourced 2.5 Turbo is big and has a lazy power delivery, put packs mammoth midrange torque.
Honda has very little torque, but has a spine tingling engine that redlines at 9250rpm.
Obviously there's the issue of no back seats in a 2000, be it  a problem or not.
If you want to get from A to B quickly, the focus will be the smoother, more refined way to do it.  If you want to get there with a manic grin on your face and experience what a sportscar drives like, then you need the honda.
In terms of thrills, the Honda wins by a mile.  If you're worried about reliability, don't be.  Did you know Honda have NEVER had a VTEC system break?  Also, the Jazz has become the first car in history to do a years production with NOT A SINGLE RECALL OR WARRANTY CLAIM!

The Honda 2000 also has a reliability index second only to the MX-5, which is britains second most reliable car.

EDIT:  Forstrch doesn't know a lot about cars.  Honda's 2 litre VTEC engine IS NOT UNRELIABLE!  It does not suffer from any problems unless you don't service it for 50,000 miles and expect it to cope.","Different vehicles...

Ford Co. of America has had one of the worst fiscal years to date. Meanwhile, Honda Co. has continually toped the charts with the highest sales volumes year-after-year.

While the Focus has not been a 'bad' car in the u.s it is just basic transportation with the SVT or ST sport variant adding a little thrill to your daily commute. However, the Honda S2000 is a full fledged sports car that is widely acclaimed and revered by many car review and testing agencies.

Don't feel bad about not buying American.  You will find that Honda America produces cars right here in the USA using American workers.  They aren't stupid... they are getting around tons of importation laws by doing that! Nobody has turned the letters H.O.N.D.A. into  Fix Or Repair Daily (FORD) for good reason... they don't break down.  You may seen one occasionally on the side of the road but for the most part those cars you see are from the big three: Ford, Chevrolet, and Chrysler. Honda is proud of their engineering and supports each make and model with superior documentation in the way of service manuals that are available to the public.  Check it out yourself by going to www.helminc.com.  Those service manuals tell you everything about your Honda and make you smart enough to do a lot of work yourself or at least talk smart with your mechanics or dealership. It seems to me that American car manufacturers are spending a lot of money engineering just how long a car will last, i.e. just outside of any warranties.  Then they make the cars in such a fashion thay you have to have special tools to do the simplest jobs.  I think this is a deal they have with their dealerships to see that their cars need servicing and the dealers are the best qualified to do that servicing. Hondas are known for good gas mileage... while some Fords do get good gas mileage, my '90 Honda Prelude is still getting that good mileage and it has 230,000 miles on it!  Go find a Ford Focus with that many miles on it and I can just about guarantee you that you wouldn't want to be the owner! Ever since my first Honda in 1991, I seldom need to get my tools out and that means more time in the car driving instead of under it getting dirty! Yep, this is a no brainer for me... Go Honda, you won't be sorry!"

Ford fiesta is a lil high on the maintenance and not that gr8 with fuel efficiency with the petrol model...the diesel is good on Efficiency but is costly. would recommend a Honda Any Day....u'll not regret the buy ever.(personal view),"Fiesta would be the best bet. I had a 1988 that I purchased used in 1990 and drove the heck out of it and even after I blew up the engine in 1994 from driving it too hard down the interstate I was able to drive the car almost 18 miles to my home with a hole big enough to put my fist in, in the side of the engine block. Not only that but I was able to purchase a good used engine from the junk yard at a cheap price and it was nothing to replace it. It only ended up costing me around $300.00 after all the work was done.","I tow broken down cars for a living and from a towing perspective I can tell you that I rarely tow a Honda that is less than 10-12 years old already and they're usually in great shape asthetically.

(Acura is a part of Honda too so those are just as good)  Most come with battery protection, if you leave your lights on it auto shuts them off, they never let you lock the doors if your key is in the ignition, etc. Dont get a ford simply because their sedan's all feel like high speeds are too much for the car to handle and they don't have good control, they are gas guzzlers and are really NOT Ford 'tough",Toyota,Ford Mustang GT Supercharged,Buy American.

I hope this helps-check out consumer reports and www.edmunds.com cause that will give you a TMV and let you know the cost to own over 1-5yrs and resale value as well as what others are paying for the same vehicle.","WELL DODGE IS RANKED THE WORST MINI VAN BY CONSUMER REPORTS AND CONSUMER REVIEW AND HAS A TERRIBLE RELIABILITY FACTOR.

HONDA HAS BEEN THE FLAG SHIP AND THE LEADER IN THE MINI VAN WARS FOR MANY MANY YEARS. GREAT  CONFORT WELL THOUGHT OUT, AND FAIRLY GOOD TO GREAT RELIABILITY. BUT THIS LAST YEAR OR TWO TOYOTA HAS REALLY PROVEN TO BE A LEADER AND HAVE THE BEST RELIABILITY CONFORT AND RESALE VALUE. SO EITHER HONDA OR TOYOTA IS THE WAY TO GO. THEY WILL RUN FOREVER AND WILL HOLD THIER VALUE. NOTHING ELSE TOUCHES THEM.","I've heard bad things about Nissan Quests from the Service Manager at my dealership. I've ridden in a Honda minivan and it seemed like it would be okay for carrying around a bunch of adults but that it wouldn't be that great for kids.

Nissan skyline gtr is a little more pratical, it has a back seat unlike the honda. has a dual turbo strait 6 engine, and is all wheel drive. if you have to deal with rain and snow, this is more desirable Supra is cheaper, but Responds VERY well to modifications.  they all can put out the same amount of power, but I think the toyota, and nissan powertrain can handle more than just the stock power. Personally, I would love to get a skyline. But thats just me.","You're not really comparing apples to apples: NSX is rear engine, rear drive.  Skyline is front engine, all-wheel drive.  Supra is front engine, rear drive. Performance, I'd say a Skyline R34.  Fully tuned it'll kick out 200 more hp than a NSX and ~100 more than a Supra.  And how can you go wrong with power to all 4 corners. Looks, I'd say the Supra.  The Skyline is a 4-door sedan.  The NSX is nice but I can't stand the stock tail lights.

Will last longer.,"you're talking about spending 30 grand/ upwards here.... get a dodge charger/ magnum or a chrysler 300c, make sure you get the HEMI in either, the 250hp V-6 is decent, it makes for a 7 second to 60 car, but the HEMI is better (of course). Looks are a matter of opinion but i prefer the charger/magnum and 300C over the bland asian looks of the accord, and the SE-R (I will give you that the SE-R is much more exciting than the accord, but not as much as the LX-platform cars, and the 3.5L VQ V6 in the altima is a great engine (won countless Ward's 10 best awards) but it is  detuned a bit from the 350Z, and that is a bit to much power for the Front Wheels) You will find that the chrysler has a very nice interior, just as good as accord, and better than nissan, The Charger/Magnum have very good interiors as well, and the utility of the magnum just can't be beat. The 300-C was Motor Trend Car of the Year the year it came out, beating the mustang, and the new corvette, it's that good, the charger is the same platform, mechanically identical. the interior is just not as fancy, the 300 is more upmarket than the dodge, but they are both very good. and these cars have rwd to handle all that power and great handling.  also the ford fusion mercury milan are very good cars, and much less, next year the lincoln zephyr will come w/ a 250hp 3.5L V6 and awd, w/ a very nice interior. The Mazda 6 is also very good maybe better, and a great sports sedan you can even get a manual w/ the v6, and the mazda mazdaspeed mazda6 is only 27 grand starting w/ awd, 6 speed manual, and amazing handling and performance (better than either altima or accord, matching the hemi cars)it has a great interior and is much sportier, and refined.

The Honda has been the best car ever owned whereas the Nissan had so many recalls and manufacturing issues that we couldn't wait to trade it.

Has more hp, 36mpg and optional keyless entry which allows you to open and start the car without physically using the key!

What it comes to is whether you want to appease your daughter, which would in a roundabout way is appeasing the manipulative boyfriend.  I think you should test-drive them both and buy whichever you feel is better.... it's your money afterall.

And, it also depends on what model years of cars you are referring to and what specific tranny (some models come with different tranny options such as automatic versus 5-spd. versus 6-spd... some with LSDs, some without, some with clutch-type LSDs, some with Torsen).  Much of the earlier Miatas used parts from the RX-7 in their trannies.  As a matter of fact, Honda sourced the Mazda 7"" rear for the S2000 (the rear housing is different and the axles are larger so nothing is a direct interchange other than the ring and pinion gears).

Transmissions contain a lot of different components from gear rings to syncros, final drives to torque convertors, fly wheels to pressure plates, half-shafts to driveshafts, gear oil to clutch fluid to tranny fluid.  In addition to the different parts, there are different actions to compare such as the length of the throw, the engagement of the clutch, the engagement of the gear, the wheelspin (or lack therof) produced by half-shafts and LSDs, how quickly flywheels and half-shafts/driveshafts spin up, how long the clutch engagment point is, etc.  Not to mention the fact that the tranny works with all of the other ""systems"" of the car to produce its feel such as the tires, the suspension, the horsepower of the engine, where you are in the engines torque curve... hell, even the stiffness of the seat you are sitting in.

You can't really compare them.  Basically, anyone trying to do a comparison will just pick the car he or she likes the best and say that that one has the best transmission.

So, in that vein, I like the MX-5's transmission the best strictly because I like the *snick*-*snick* sound it makes engaging its gears.  ;-P","Well, this question is subjective.

oracle,postgresql,What are the differences between PostgreSQL and Oracle?,"PostgreSQL is a free object-relational database server (database management system), released under a flexible BSD-style license. It offers an alternative to other open-source database systems (such as MySQL and Firebird), as well as to proprietary systems such as Oracle, Sybase, IBM's DB2 and Microsoft SQL Server. Similar to other open-source projects such as Apache and Linux, PostgreSQL is not controlled by any single company, but relies on a community of global developers and companies to develop it.

However, the additional features of Oracle may come with a hefty fee. License fees are the general reason why people might want to go for PostgreSQL. The fact that it is Open Source allows programmers not just to make additions through the API but also directly to the engine, e.g. introducing specific data types for whichever reason. Without inclusion into the general distribution such isolated solutions will cause more problems than they solve in the long run, though."
ibm,microsoft,"Can some one tell me difference between Oracle, Microsoft and IBM ETL Tools?","Oracle has Oracle Warehouse Builder, a GUI tool that creates jobs for moving data into an Oracle warehouse by generating database code.
Microsoft has DTS in older versions of SQL Server and SQL Server Integration Services in the 2005 version.  SSIS uses a GUI tool to build data flows that move data in and out of SQL Server databases and introduces some data quality functions such as fuzzy matching and text mining.
IBM has the WebSphere Information Integration suite including DataStage for ETL and while the Oracle and Microsoft tools are free with Enterprise Editions the IBM tool is priced per CPU on the ETL server.  For this price you get a lot of extra functionality such as native connectivity to a wide range of databases, parallel processing for very large volumes and a greater range of transformation stages.

So it really depends on data volumes, operating systems, budgets and database platforms as to which product is right for you.  Oracle and SQL Server mainly target users of their RDBMS platforms and Microsoft do not support running on Unix or Linux.","Oracle has Oracle Warehouse Builder, a GUI tool that creates jobs for moving data into an Oracle warehouse by generating database code.

Well an Apple person would tell you the Apple, and I am an Windows person so of course I would say the Sony. It is really a matter of which one suits your needs better.

Apple computers are well built but, they are very expensive. If you are doing video editing, or any multimedia, the Mac is better.  For Dell vs. Sony, if you want a cheap quality built computer, go with Dell. They are very cheap and there are many coupons you can use on the internet such as up to $750 off. Sony laptops are usually expensive and they are not of bad quality.

Not sure on exact prices of each, but I'm willing to guess Dell would end up as the cheaper option. Dell vs Apple? The Apple is a powerful machine, no doubt, but I am an IBM compatible kinda guy (even though Apples can have partitions blah blah blah) I chose a long time go to stick with IMB compatible machines and away from Apples.","it depends on what u need it for? what do u want to do with it? etc. do your research first. I have a e-machine wide screen and love it! the thing I find most important is service. Most , like dell, compaq, hp, will send u to @#!#$  Bangladesh for service . e-machine(gateway) is here in the good ol' USA. it's all what u order on the inside ( chip, motherboard, hard drive, wireless? etc. that matters. also, all manufactures have refurbished ( open box)stores on line for great deals.   try www.tigerdirect.com also. they have great deals on laptops.  good luck!","This is not an apples to apples question. If price is the driving factor go with the Dell since it is cheapest by a long shot. Sony makes a high quality product, particularly when it comes to the screen. The low power models also get great battery life. You will pay a premium for the Sony which may not be proportional to the increase in quality. As for Apple. If you get the iBook G4 you will only be able to run Apple software. If you can move up a bit in price you can get the Macbook Pro starting at $1999 or less if you can get the student or government discount. The Macbook pro will also let you install Windows XP using Boot Camp. This makes the transition very easy as you can install all of your old windows programs in the XP partition and you can slowly migrate to all Mac over time instead off all at once with the iBook.",The SONY is the best mark of laptop that i know.,"You are looking at all very similar laptops. Consider there have been a few improvements over the last 3 years - and your older unit may not have the battery that new ones would, built in connectivity also?

If that difference isn't material, go up to that level VAIO/Dell/MAC - if not consider what other extras are important to you and how compatability from Apple is. What you do with this unit in the field is important too - can you get by with a new phone?"
apple,sony,"What's  the best notebook brand and why? Dell, Sony Vaio, Apple, Toshiba, IBM, ... ? (in general comparison)","I have had a Toshiba Satellite A60 for 2 years now. I wouldn't buy a Toshiba laptop again. The colors on the display are very pale, although it doesn't have any dead pixels (yet). S Video TV out never worked properly, and it's DVD ROM decided to not read DVD's anymore about a week ago.

A firend of mine also has a Toshiba laptop (different model) and although the colors are brighter and DVD ROM still works, it heats up so bad that you can barely touch the touchpad.

Also, battery life is BAD with Toshiba.

I'm planning to buy a Sony Vaio when I'll have enough money.",WELL I HAVE A DELL LAB TOP AND IT SEEMS TO WORK FINE SO I DEFINETLY WOULD RECOMEND A DELL,I would not recommend Dell at all. From what I have read in Smart Computing Dell has about the worst tech support and computers ever. Though I can not recall all the stories or names of the people one story does stand out.  A woman bought a Dell laptop for about 900 and left it in her car one night. The computer froze and the screen cracked. Dell said that they would replace the screen for free. So she sent the computer off to Dell. Dell called back and told her that the computer would cost 960 dollars or so to fix. Not replace just fix the screen. The lady wrote Smart Computing and since they have more power than a regular person does and they cleared the issue up for the woman.  This is just one of the many Dell horror stories. Other stories include Dell promising to replace things with new parts only to put refurbished parts in the computer and then the parts burning out shortly after. Dell charging people for things they never bought or charging them for things that were covered under the warranty. The list goes on. Every month there is at least one letter of complaint about Dell in SC and they aren't the only company who consumers have problems with but they do seem to have the worst and most problems.  Personally I wouldn't go with any of the big name computer companies except for Apple. STOP! I know what you are thinking . 'I'm going to go buy an Apple.' Don't just yet. Apple makes a good solid computer BUT if you are not ready for a completely different operating system I do not recommend that you get an Apple. If I were out to buy a laptop I would find a friend who knows his or her computers and then have them help you through the part selection process over at http://www.ibuypower.com. They have a good selection of computers at a very nice price and do not practice those weird gimmicks that places like Dell do where they say you can get the computer for 'as low as xxx' but it turns out to be a good bit more than that because the base parts they use are sub-par technologies. But yeah that's just what I would do. The best thing is to read up on these companies and have that tech savvy friend help compare the 'bang for the buck' factor at all the different laptop manufacturers.,"If you plan to work on graphics software lie Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Corel Draw etc choose Mac systems. If you want to use a windows based operating sytstem use Toshiba. It guarantees best performance. HP laptops has Better graphics cards and good bundling and good pricing.

gamecube,ps2,which is better ps2 xbox or gamecube?,gamecube out of the way and some competition between ps2 and the xbox but as we have seen better games released on the ps2 and people more demand on ps2 makes me feel that ps2 is better,xbox,gamecube: has remakes of old games ex; mario Ps2: is more for a one person game  ex; san andreas XboX: is more for multiplayer ex; halo + XboX live so 'play' to your strengths in my opinion go for XboX,PS2 because it has the most selection and quality out of the three.,Xbox you have the hard drive so you never need a memory card. You can save music to it. They have some of the best titles like Halo.  The only thing I like better about PS2 is the controller.,Ps2<Gamecube<Xbox,gamecube out of the way and some competition between ps2 and the xbox but as we have seen better games released on the ps2 and people more demand on ps2 makes me feel that ps2 is better,"gamecube is good for kids and if you like the mario games and stuff.  The competition is between XBOX and PS2 but i think PS2 is better, controllers are simpler and some of the best games are only made for the PS2. Then with the PS3 coming out it will wipe out the competition.",PS2,"PS2 has the most (and some of the best) games, Gamecube has better graphics and games, and Xbox...has Halo.  Some strengths: PS2: Better for RPGs, racing games, has some of the best action/adventure games.  And plays old PS1 games. Gamecube: Best for platformers (Mario, Zelda, Fox, etc.) Xbox: Best for internet-based games (Halo)",PS2 for all around system. Gamecube is better for kids. Xbox was a Bill Gates product...Nuff Said.,"PS2 is definately the best, Internet, Games for All Ages, Great Graphics, only downside is it only comes with 2 controller ports so you need a multi tap, but thats it!",ps2 has more games and the gamecube is made for younger players but by far the best system for game play a graphics is the xbox,"Xbox is blatently the best. I say this on the terms that the online market is now where games are heading, and xbox live controls that market. PS2 may have online capabilities, but you can not make a 'name' for yourself, where as with an xbox, you make a name, and all your achievements are logged, and you get credit for this.  Lets say you were at the top of the battlefield 2 modern combat ladders, you would get offers to play at tournaments, offered chances that you would not get with a PS2, or gamecube. If you value gameplay, and a good community of gamers, then its xbox all the way. If you prefer kiddies games then its gamecube. If you prefer a dieing console, then its PS2."
gamecube,ps2,"What's better? XBOX, GAMECUBE or PS2?","This is merely an opinion question.  I work at best buy selling all of these systems so I deal with the same question all the time.  Depending on the age range of the players it should work as follows.  If you're like 14-whatever, X-box would be something to look into.  Most of those games are aimed more towards teens and older players.  Graphics wise the PS2 and X-box are very close however the X-box pulls out a little ahead.  The PS2 has a wide range of games and will give you a broader age range. If you are looking for your kids and you to play it, I would suggest the PS2.  Gamecube is for the youngsters that are into Disney and stuff.  They aimed more for the younger players who aren't old enough for bloody violence.  If you have the money and are more towards teenagers and up, I would highly suggest the X-box 360.  Graphics are killer, and it is a new system.  If you can find one and you have the $400, I would get the one with the hard drive, as you can then play the original X-box games, store music for custom soundtracks, save games, etc.  But hopefully this answered your question.","This is merely an opinion question.

The reason: the new Zelda is coming out this year and it will be one of the Top 5 games for the year.  Then the new Nintendo system, Revolution, is backwards compatible so you can play all your Gamecube games on it (Super Smash Bros Melee, Zelda: Wind Waker, Star Wars: Rogue Leader, Donkey Konga 2, and so on).  Plus I think they have the best controller, the wireless WaveBird.  The other choice, like many said here, is PS2 'cuz it has tons of games and is only $30 more.  The PS3 is predicted to be superexpensive, while the Revolution will be much more affordable (Nintendo said less than $300).",i have a gamecube and wish i got a ps2 way more games
gamecube,ps2,"Which is better, a gamecube or a ps2?","I'm in my 30s and I happen to have a gamecube, a PS2, and an XBOX. Here's my (extremely) brief take on each system.

GameCube:
While I agree about the family friendly thing in general, there are Mature games available. I think the GC excels in multiplayer party style games and arcade/adventure games like Mario. Games are often cheaper too. Nintendo's strengths are focus on gameplay, weakness is lack of 3rd party support

PS2:
Great all-around system, especially if you're into RPGs. Has the biggest library of games available

XBOX/XBOX 360:
Another good all-around system. Arguably the best in graphics although that doesn't necessarily mean the games themselves are better. Game library, especially for 360 platform is relatively small and more expensive. Decent selection of sports and racing games, very weak on RPGs

Just my personal take on the three systems. And yes, I'll be getting the PS3 and the Revolution (or Go or whatever Nintendo calls it) when they come out.","I'm in my 30s and I happen to have a gamecube, a PS2, and an XBOX.

Gamecube is kind of like a toy where as PS2 is a Gaming system more for Teens and young adults ages 14-30.,"If you like Mario etc . . ., go for the gamecube, if you want less exclusive games, go for the PS2.

I have all three systems and it really depends what type of games you like to play.  PS2 has the largest library so if you play all sorts of games go with that.  Gamecube has the most exclusive titles, Zelda, Mario, Metroid, etc.  If you want to play a Mario game, and there are some great ones, you have to have the GameCube.

If you have BroadBand, Its very easy to play online games. Just make sure you get the smaller playstation2 . It already has a ethernet connection port.","PS2 TOTALLY hands down, they r selling gamecubes for 25 bucks online. Also most of the games on gamecube are childish games, just go to gamespot.com. click on the link for gamecube and check out the games, And compare the games to PS2 games.

It's not too complicated as with xbox you have so many buttons. You can't get all the games you want with PS2 either so that's the downside.

gamecube,ps2,xbox 360 vs. other xbox versions or gamecube or ps2?,"With children in your age range I would go with Nintendo Wii. It's the cheaper of the 3 ""Next Gen"" gaming consoles.

Also the Wii is much more interactive and built for younger, less experienced gamers.

In comparison, XBOX 360 and PS3 are the more expensive counterparts (with XBOX 360 being the cheaper of the 2). The graphics between the two are roughly the same. The major difference between the two is that XBOX will be running HDDVDs and PS3 runs Blu-Ray disc.

None of the features with 360 and PS3 will make a difference with children of your age.

The Wii, although it could be tough to get before the holidays (XBOX 360 would be the easiest) is a lot of fun, and has an array of kids games (which the other two lack).","With children in your age range I would go with Nintendo Wii.

Alot of great titles and very much kid friendly.  My kids are now 13 and 10.  It is an older system now that the Wii is out, but it is still a great system and they are still releasing new titles for it for now.  How much longer is the real question though. I now also have an Xbox 360 because I really wanted the Xbox Live feature of it to play online against other people.  The language online is horrible and most of the games are violent FPS (first person shooter) games.  I have four games for the 360 and I cannot even find something I want to buy.  (I have Kameo, Madden 06, Burnout Revenge, and MLB Baseball 2k6).  Xbox had said that the 360 would be more family friendly than the original xbox, but I think they have fallen short on that ad claim.  Just go to any electonic store and see how many Mature rated games the 360 has out. Here is a good example: One of the more violent games for the gamecube that I play is 'James Bond 007 Nightfire'.  I recently tried a demo for 'Hitman: Blood Money' on the Xbox 360.  The difference?  James Bond is killing the bad guys to save the world, and only doing so when necessary.  He can put them to sleep with darts in some missions.  In Hitman, you are a paid assasin - that is you murder people for money.  It has some very graphic killing scenes and girls in their underwear, heavy drug references, profanity - you name it....   I cannot remeber ever having someone swear on any of my gamecube games.  I put in Hitman and a thug comes up to you and says 'mother(bleepp)'. Do not get a Xbox 360 for your kids!!!!   If you can afford it, go with the new Nintendo Wii.  If not, you could go with the Nindendo Gamecube, but that will become old very fast. Note: I have absolutely no experience with any Sony Playstation, sorry.","i say xbox 360 got less games for kids of that age, so thats one reason but it has good graphics and stuff then any of the systems you guys have.

It's quite detailed. For the second, well, it's all about the games. Gamecube has a radically different lineup than the PS2 and Xbox, so it depends on what you're looking for. PS2 and Xbox have similar lineups (a lot of cross-platform games between the two), so the real deciding factor is the franchises - do you like the Xbox-specific games like Halo, or the PS2-specific games like Jak & Daxter? I personally own both a PS2 and a GameCube and love them both. I also have an Xbox 360, so I can play some of the Xbox games, but I only have 2 and probably won't get any others. And with DS vs PSP, if you want to play games the clear winner is the DS. It has the much more innovative and engaging control interface (dual screens, touch screen, microphone, etc) and has a lot more and better games for it. There's a reason the DS is outselling the PSP by about 10 to 1. Pretty much the only reason to get a PSP is if you really want to watch movies on a tiny little screen. And personally, I know of *nobody* who wants that. There's a good reason Sony's UMD format is a huge flop.","Definately the Wii. The 360 and PS3 are for people who want crisp, clear graphics. The Wii is for those who want to have fun.","MICROSOFT, i enjoy all its fun games.",its not called the revolution anymore. its the nintendo wii.,"out of ps3, xbox 360, and the wii id have to say the 360 cuz its the only 1 u can play so far and own out of xbox, ps2, gamecube id have to say xbox cuz its got the best graphics and u dont have to but a memory card out of psp, ds id have to say psp because more ppl have it ur welcome :), Dacadac","For me, it's a tossup between Gamecube and PS2.  I have them both...it just depends on what games I want to play...but I think the PS2 is more versatile.  But I like it better than XBox anyway because I just don't like the Xbox's controllers.  too big.  I just read up on the ps3 though, and i think that sounds much better than xbox360, but I don't have $500.  so....the nintendo wii sounds like a lot more fun and *cough* affordable"

Afterall, the Xbox was already better than the PS2 and that was last gen. Blu-ray this, blu-ray that, how many of you have looked into the whole blu-ray technology? Blu-ray is one of the next gen media formats as it is competing with HD-DVD. Not only does the media cost more than DVD, to use blu-ray you have to have an HDMI or DVI-D connection. i.e., you TV has to take those inputs. Blu-ray only output High Definition signals to those connections. Developers aren't going to jump on the bandwagon and create games on blu-ray media. Its still going to be DVD, at least for some time. Don't believe me? Just wait and see. There is a lot of cost associated with blu-ray. The great blu-ray is for movie purposes. Then why is Sony talking about blu-ray as though its the best thing since slice bread? Its because blu-ray is a Sony product and they are competing with HD-DVD. Putting it in the PS3 is a way for Sony to use gamers to win the media format war. As a gamer who wants a PS3 you don't have a choice but to support blu-ray.","It will actually have better competition from the competition (PS2 was weaker than Xbox and GC, don't know about Dreamcast).

The PS3 is too expensive.  It's also coming out with a lot of the same titles as 360, which is less expensive. Everyone keeps talking about how Nintendo releases childish games.  Well, of course that's their target audience.  And it's not like you can't have fun with a 'childish' game from time to time.  And everyone fails to mention that the Wii also has Call of Duty 3, Red Steel, Resident Evil, etc. and those will be really interesting to play with the wiimote or the gun version of the wiimote (I think it's called the zapper).","I'm gonna wait awhile, but I will definitely get the PS3 if that's the only system that Final Fantasy 13 comes out on..",you should get a wii because the ps3 is not that fun I have played it and you should wait till they lower the price on it,it's only that ps3's have better graphics wii's to me don't look good at all (that's my opinion),"I would get a Wii....Unless you have an HDTV the value of the PS3 is about zero.  Think about this.....when DVD players originally came out they were around $500, and what do they cost now?  The PS3 is only as expensive as it is because they put a blue-ray player on it.  Without that it would most likely cost less than the XBOX 360.  If you want to waste your money on something that has to have a dramatic price drop within 2 years go for it, but I would put my money with the Wii.",Wii's don't have good graphics or good games. They were mostly designed for little kids or old people. I would go with a 360 or PSP.,"i would go for the wii, the main reason for that is because i like everything Nintendo does.  But think i can back it up...  Nintendo is starting to rear away from the PlayStation and xbox companies. because they are going for new and interesting ways to play games not only go for amazing graphics.  they came out with the wireless controller first (i think) then the Nintendo DS and its duel screen and now the wii with its new and innovative way of game play.  The xbox and PS company are now competing for better graphics, i think xbox is gana die and give halo to PlayStation.  while Nintendo is coming out with a virtual video game without a motion sensitive controller.  if you like graphics and long fun games then get the PS3.  If u like innovative and creative ways of game play, like Mario and super smash brothers and easy access to Internet then get a wii (don't get a 360)","Oh.. My.. GOD!! I can't take it anymore. The only valid argument against the Wii I've heard yet is that the graphics aren't specfreakintacular. If graphics are deal-breaker for you, don't bother. The Wii is being marketed for everyone, not exclusively children and the elderly. Point me towards the Grannies playing Red Steel or the toodler playing Call of Duty 3. Simply for not completely excluding entire demographics, it gets called a kid's system. It doesn't give you a workout and the Surgeon General isn't about to start recomending everyone buy a Wii instead of doing step arobics. All it takes to generate actions is a flick of your wrist. I've said it before and it deserves to be said again. If you can't manage that, you've got bigger problems than which system you should pick up. Now, I haven't called anyone out on the fact that XBox players are all ADHD kids who stood in the same place for more than ten minutes, for the first time since birth, when the 360 was released because they think a $300 system is totally worth it to play Halo 3. I didn't say anything about Sony fans being the unfortunate result of a society that believes that if no one is being killed, nothing's happening and that the PS3 is really just another example of all the Special Effects in the world to draw you away from it's morbidly over-used themes and content so preditable you could set a clock by it. I haven't said these things up until now. Why? Because they're unfair generalizations that by no means apply to either of these groups of people, if anyone at all. If I can express myself without calling anyone that disagrees with me children, surely you all can too. So knock-it off. If you can think of something logical to say, great. I love information. But all this 'kiddy' system and 'too much effort' crap is getting real old and I'm pretty fed up with every completely substanceless argument being parroted over and over by people that can't think for themselves. This is not an attack on anyone who posted, just something I'm tired of hearing about. Now, to answer the question. If you have a PS2, like it, and have the cash get a PS3. I'm sure it's exactly what you're looking for. The Wii is nothing like your PS2, so if that's the experince you're looking for, the Wii would be a total waste of money. Infact, it's a straight one or the other sort of thing, get the PS3. Unless you're really unsatisfied with your PS2, you probably won't like the Wii as much as you'll like the PS3. The PS3 is radicaly superior to the PS2 in all mesurable ways.",the ps3  would be my choice but it way to expensive.,Get the Wii....

ps2,ps3,How is the new PS3 gonna be better than the PS2?,"it will be 499$ for the 20 gb version and 599$ for the 60 gb version.........

The differences are more than skin deep...though those chrome highlights on the 60 GB model sure bring out our shallow side
We know it hurts, but the key reason for the price is the next-gen DVD format war. The PS3 will be Sony's first big mass-market Blu-ray player, making it a key strategy to capturing the lead in the next-gen format war... but the bad news is, we'll all pay for that decision. The Blu-ray drive is probably the single most expensive component inside the PS3.

The $499 model has all the same core capabilities of its bigger brother, with a few key deficiencies. It lacks HDMI video output, a sacrifice that's meaningless to the vast majority of gamers (component cables work just fine, thanks). It's also missing the integrated Wi-Fi receiver, the multi-format memory card reader, and it's got a smaller hard drive.

There are also eye-catching chrome highlights on the pricier 60 GB model. We still think the 20 GB model looks plenty slick, however

Which PS3 model should I buy? The 20 GB or the 60 GB?
That's up to you. But unless you're ga-ga for HDMI video output, or you're dead-set on using integrated Wi-Fi functionality, the $499 model will be the better deal. It's the exact same machine, with a few less frills. And you can always install a bigger hard drive or Wi-Fi access later, if you want

It's quite detailed. For the second, well, it's all about the games. Gamecube has a radically different lineup than the PS2 and Xbox, so it depends on what you're looking for. PS2 and Xbox have similar lineups (a lot of cross-platform games between the two), so the real deciding factor is the franchises - do you like the Xbox-specific games like Halo, or the PS2-specific games like Jak & Daxter? I personally own both a PS2 and a GameCube and love them both. I also have an Xbox 360, so I can play some of the Xbox games, but I only have 2 and probably won't get any others. And with DS vs PSP, if you want to play games the clear winner is the DS. It has the much more innovative and engaging control interface (dual screens, touch screen, microphone, etc) and has a lot more and better games for it. There's a reason the DS is outselling the PSP by about 10 to 1. Pretty much the only reason to get a PSP is if you really want to watch movies on a tiny little screen. And personally, I know of *nobody* who wants that. There's a good reason Sony's UMD format is a huge flop.","Definately the Wii. The 360 and PS3 are for people who want crisp, clear graphics.

In softball pitches are underhand. Men and women do play together and when they do, men hit a different sized ball than women (the womens' ball is smaller). Different leagues I've played in have different rules. I played in one league that had a line drawn with chalk dividing the outfield. Players couldn't cross that line when a woman was at bat until she had hit the ball. The lineup for coed play has to alternate men and women. If a man walks with two outs then the woman up next has the option to walk also, so the man gets to walk to second. My womens' team has played in tournaments all over the place and one year in the state we got rained out on Saturday and had to go to a one-pitch format for Sunday. If it's a strike and you don't swing you're out. If it's a ball you walk. If you hit it foul you're out. It really turns the whole situation into a hitter's game and makes it way more challenging."

baseball,softball,What do you think is better...softball or baseball?,"Depends on what aspect and type of softball your referring to. 

Slowpitch softball is alright, although it's pretty much a hitter's game and the most intriguing question is who's going to buy the beer aftewards.

Fastpitch softball is a fantastic game, particulary in regards to the different types of pitches.  The only complaint I have, particularly once you get into the higher levels (women's college world series, for example), is that the games are so low scoring.  You get to see the best pitchers dominate the best hitters, but a 1-0 game with 18 Ks by one pitcher is tough to swallow night after night.  I also wish there were a few more extra base hits - it seems that if it's not a slap single, it's a HR.  Plus I get confused with the switching rules of when a player can go and re-enter.

Baseball seems to be the more complex of the two, particularly when you look at the specialization in certain areas, particularly pitching.  There seems to be a bit more going on throughout the game as far as strategy, but the same could be said for softball.

For fun, it's softball.  For strategy and complexity, I'll take baseball.","Depends on what aspect and type of softball your referring to.

The increased size of the softball allows for a rising fastball. In baseball, if you threw a horizontal fastball (has backspin) the ball would drop, as you increased the spin rate the ball would drop slower but would still drop. Though I have not tested everyone in the world, I don't believe there is a human being able to make the ball spin fast enough to cause it to rise from aerodynamics alone. On the other hand, in softball, a rising fastball is possible by a good high school pitcher and outfielder throw rising fastballs all the time on their throws to the infield.","well, in softball, ummmmm you idk really...♥",they both suck.,there both fun,In baseball you can take as big a lead as you can as a base runner.,The hardness of the ball.,"Baseball- 9 innings, 9 players, base paths 90 feet, pitching plate to home 60'6', four pitched balls for a walk, pitch is overhand and fast, no aluminum bats, home to second base 127' 3', stealing bases ok, leave base to run when ball leaves the pitcher's hand, score can be 1-0 or 65 to 10. usually play only 1  game per day.

baseball,softball,What is the Difference between softball and baseball??,"Softball like baseball is played by men and women. There are two types of softball, fast pitch and slow pitch. Four main differences between soft ball and baseball are that the ball is larger in the game of softball,the ball is pitched underhand, the bases are situated closer together and the pitching mound is considerably closer to the batter.

While slow pitch softball is more a leisurely recreational game with much activity because the ball is pitched slow with a required arc  and scoring is usually frequent, fast pitch softball is more a pitcher oriented low scoring game. Even the best of batters in fastball have difficulty hitting. Batting against top notch pitchers in fast pitch soft ball is not for the faint of heart. The ball comes from the mound which is only 40-46 feet away, and at speeds upwards of 80 mph. Soft ball games are usually only 7 innings long and in top competitive games it is not unusual for pitchers to attain 12 -15 strikeouts. 
Believe me, some of the best MLB players would have difficulty looking good at the plate in elite player fastball (softball) games, whether it is a man or a woman pitching.","Softball like baseball is played by men and women.

baseball,softball,Who thinks playing softball is harder than playing baseball or are they the same?,"First off whoever believes that baseball is harder because they've played it don't know what they're talking about.  They have to play BOTH sports to answer this question.  I have not.  I've only played fast pitch softball.  

My opinion though is that I think it varies in certain areas.  Yea, hitting a baseball at 90 mph would be harder than hitting something larger coming in at about 60 mph, but softball is a lot closer and the direction of where the pitch comes from is different.  The field is shorter in softball, but baseball does get harder, faster hits.  Also, softball is a quicker played game because of the field difference.  The plays have to clean, but same with baseball if they want to get the double play.  I think that both sports are great thought and I love it!","First off whoever believes that baseball is harder because they've played it don't know what they're talking about.

Seeing that it is basically two different games it would be hard to say which is harder. If you are familar with both of the games you will understand what I mean.,"Well i play baseball so i know this question. When your playing baseball, the ball always comes in faster because its a lighter weight, which could make it more or less dificult to hit, but in softball, the average speed coming in is about 60 mph.(underhand pitching), and the fact that a softball is a bigger object, you could make contact more often than being pitched a 70-90 mph. baseball. Softball is much easier than baseball!!!!",well baseball is made of harder stuff compared to softball.,in softball i beleive there is alot less room for error. with baseball if u knock the ball down u can go get it and still throw the runner out but in softball u practicle have to make a clean play. With the shortened and smaller field. but on the other hand the ball is usually going alot quiker when playing baseball or so it seems on a baseball field,"If it's fast-pitched softball, I think it's tougher.  Much less distance between the pitcher's mound and home, so the ball is on you that much faster.",the same i think,"slow pitch softball or fast pitch..?? harder to hit a baseball, as a ball is basically lobbed in slow pitch softball. more action in softball on the defensive side..  more ball in play.. its a wash.."

But, it does have some good exclusive titles like Metroid and Zelda. Playstation 2 - If you can get one of the newer, slimmer ones, get one.  They have online built in, and they are so small and light.  It is the only place you can get your Final Fantasy fix, and it sells for about $129.  It probably has the most games out there.  The online service is free. XBOX - In my opinion, the best.  It has a hard drive to store your games, so you don't have to worry about running out of space for your games or changing out memory cards.

gamecube,playstation,"What game system is better Gamecube, Playstation 2, or X-box?","PS2 followed by GameCube then X-box. PS2 have lots of good solid games(FFX,FFVII""backward compatibility"",Xenosaga,Gran Turismo,Winning Eleven) but some of the best quality games can be found in Gamecube list of games(Zelda,Mario). Xbox(I can only think of Halo sorry) need a lot of catching up.","PS2 followed by GameCube then X-box.

And forget about Alienware.  What a joke!  Build your own comp with parts just as good if not better, and SAVE MASS CASH over their lame prices. For those of you who enjoy sitting back in a couch with a beer in one hand, fine!  You got to have 'console' like playability?  lol... buy a keypad controller (despite how laughably limiting those are...) and download MAME for your computer.",xbox. hands down. ps2.. way overrated.,how come there's nothin' like PSBoX?,I vote PS2,ps2,I vote XBOX2. its much better and cheaper,"most of the games nowadays require ample amount of buttons to adjust on the characters' controls. more buttons means more actions available. on the console part, this is how i see it. console's has it's own pros and cons. for exaple: xbox has better graphics than ps2 nad gamecube but it has less favorable titles. most of the games i like came out on the ps2. ps2 has better graphics than the gamecube and it has a lot of games that are awesome and many more that sucks. it just can't beat xbox's graphics. and as for the gamecube, it might be on last place on the graphics part but it's games are the most top quality games out there. the cube's games have the most replayability and it's good for all kinds of gamers. all in all, each console is better than the other in it's own ways. it all comes down to a matter of taste in games. try to determine in which platform  do the games that you like reside, then choose. or if you still can't decide, go cross platforming if you have money to spare. as for me, i went with the xbox since i like most of the games there. specially halo. just can't get enough of masterchief. there! hope that helps.","Since u don't like too many buttons, gamecube is best. Otherwise I vote PS2.",PS2 is my life,"Gamecube is a nice console for puzzle games nd generally kiddie games. PS2 is a good all round console, nice mix of games and great variety and catalog of cheap games. Xbox is more of a 1st person shooter console then the others and its games are definitly more adult and late teen orientated. It just depends on your tastes really. All 3 consoles have basically the same line up, nothing (bar the excellent Halo on Xbox) is exclusive to either ps2 or xbox. Nintendo only games such as Zelda and Mario are the core of the gamecube. Another deciding factor is the online aspect. Xbox live is brilliant to say the least, I own all 3 consoles and the xbox i feel is the strongest of the 3, i even bought a 360 i was so impressed! Oh and if you are worried about the controller, which i was, the xbox's one fits neatly into the hand (provided you are over the age of 12!!), in fact i found the gamecubes to be the most cumbersome. Hope that helps.",playstation2,"Ok dude, from my opinion Playstation 2 of course is the best console cuz' PS2 got a lot of games that other consoles don't have such as Final Fantasy series, Devil May Cry series...etc. Gamecube is not a good console cuz' lack of great games but GC got Zelda, Mario, Pokemon, all these games can't found in other consoles but instead of GC you should replace it with Gameboy Advance or Nintendo DS. As for X-Box, if you are looking for sports games more than others, then you should choose X-Box cuz' I think the games it has are majority sports games. Although the X-Box has the most beautiful 3D effects among PS2 and GC but the lack of great and hot games just like GC and too much buttons are the deadly weaknesses of X-Box. I can tell you in my country (Malaysia) out of 100%, I think 97% play PS2 instead of other consoles and all the game companies are focusing on PS2 or PS3 and its future series. Hope the points I gave can help you decide well.",i personally like ps2. there's a wide variety of games...such as the world renoun DDR! gamecube is good for family friendly games xbox--not really sure about this one...none of my friends have it. we all have ps2s and gcs....,"I like PS2, I do have a X-box but I like my PS2 better.","you people ! ps2 is overrated, def xbox, but i LOVE my gamecube as well, trust me i know what ones are best i own all three, i have evry system that ever came out before psp ps2 gamecube xbox gba gb ds sega ps1 dreamcast sega portable thingy atari nes super nes and more but ya thats still alot right there mind you besides the older ones i bought every newer system by myself i am 15 tommorow and i work for these things so im not spoiled i have 2 part time jobs",id rather ps 2.,playstation 2,Atari!

Nintendo all the way.,"Like you, I am not a huge gamer. I just like to play a few video games here and there for fun. I don't get too obsessed with any video game, in fact I usually only play when there's company! I have a gamecube because I like the Mario Party and Mario Kart series for when we have get-togethers at the house. It's pretty inexpensive, and I like that option of having wireless controllers.",Playstation 2,"I've got both........ The PS2 has more games available for it... though not necessarily quality ones. But is the best if you like super realistic driving games + you can play CD's & DVD's on it. Controller for it is the most neatly laid out. Recommended games for it include: Gran Turismo3, Gran Turismo4, F1 2002, The Simpsons: Hit & Run The Gamecube...... you can pick them up cheap now, and it sits nicely on top of my older PS2. Can only play Gamecube Game disks on it (not CD's or DVD movie disks).  But the games for it are top notch, and last a hell of a long time (Biggest memorycard you can afford is highly recommended). Top games for it include...... That I have: 'The Simpsons: Hit & Run' (graphics for it look slightly better than on the PS2 & XBOX versions I thought) 'Super Mario: Sunshine' - huge 3D game featuring one of the all time great characters in computer gaming. Been playing it on & off since last September, and still ain't finished it. 'The Legend of Zelda: Collectors Edition' - this disk is pretty special, as it contains both the original ZELDA games from the NES ported over to Gamecube, and also 'The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask' & 'The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time' ported over from the N64 (though they do suffer a few minor glitches occasionally) + a demo of 'The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker'. Games that are supposed to be good, but I ain't bought yet: 'Luigi's Mansion' 'Mario Golf: Toadstool Tour' 'MarioKart: Double Dash' 'Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door' 'Star Fox Adventures' 'Star Fox Assault' More Games, reviews & Screenshots can be found @ http://uk.gamespot.com/gamecube/index.html & http://uk.gamespot.com/ps2/index.html",If you want to know which one to buy go to a pawn shop.

I like their version of Donkey Kong.,"Playstation 2 has better graphics and more games. Although Gamecube is nintendo which usually = fun, it is their least successful console. I would recommend Kingdom Hearts for ps2 which is really fun. Star wars battlefront is a fun shooting game.",Hmm. I suguest a PS2. A gamecube is for children. Unless you like kiddie games then go with the gamecube.,it depends nintendo games are mainly for the younger kids while the ps2 targets teens to young adults while xbox on the other hand goes for a mature audience (mostly m rated games) if you like to go online and have multiplayer games xbox is the way to go

Every game system has a positive in my opinion.","Playstation2 has the wide selection of games, but the console is showing its age, but still shines in some ways.

concrete,wood,What are the pros and cons of using wooden ties vs. concrete ties?,"Wood ties are the standard choice... Hardwoods, treated with creosote, they have an extended service lives. They can be layed and used anywhere, individually -- since the spikes are simply pounded in, the wood ties can be used in a switch or anywhere without modification. They are however more prone to rot, damage, and even fire when oil soaked from locomotives.

Concrete ties are becoming more numerous. They are more rigid than wood, and are not prone to rot, and are pre-treated for expansion/contraction like the welded rail they hold. They are associated with higher speed trackage due to not needing the upkeep of wood. One con of concrete would be the hardware associated with hold the rail -- special ties are required for specific locations and uses, unlike wood. Also, 2 (and I've seen 1) man could move a wood tie in a repair, while concrete is heavier and usually layed by machine (crane).","Wood ties are the standard choice...

While wooden ties are cheaper they do no have a lifespan of concrete, although concrete is a bit more expensive.  Composite ties are another new innovation out there.  Whereas they have a lifespan comparable to concrete, they are cheaper and much more flexible than concrete (and can also be recycled for re-use).  My guess is that eventually, long into the future, wooden ties will become obselete because of their environmental impact as well as shorter lifespan (35-50 years).",Wood rots and is usually treated with chemicals.

bread,pizza,How is pizza dough different from bread dough?,"pizza dough is a simpler dough, only proofs (or rises) once, while most breads require 2 proofs, but have more in the way of texture and flavor.","pizza dough is a simpler dough, only proofs (or rises) once, while most breads require 2 proofs, but have more in the way of texture and flavor.","Pizza Dough Recipe  There has been a clamor for years to get me to post a pizza recipe. So here it is. A few tips: Always use bread flour, which has more protein. If you don't have a pizza stone, cook the pizza on a preheated cookie sheet. This will make it brown much better. Have you ingredients at room temperature, at least the ones that won't spoil. And consider precooking the meats. This pizza cooks about ten minutes. Cold toppings may not cook well. This recipe will make two medium pizzas. Sponge: 3/4 cup warm water 1 tsp sugar 1/4 oz active fry yeast 1 tsp flour 1/2 tsp salt 2 tbsp olive oil 3 cups bread flour Sauce: 4 oz tomato sauce 2 oz tomato paste 1 tsp garlic powder 1 tsp oregano 1/2 tsp salt 1/2 tsp sugar  Mix together the sponge ingredients (first four ingredients). The water should be warm but not hot. Let that stand for 5 minutes or so. Then add the olive oil and salt.  From this point forward the goal is to use as little flour as possible.  Start mixing in flour 1/2 cup at a time, mixing well between each addition. You probably won't get past the 1 1/2 cup point before the mixture gets too think to mix in more flour, but this will vary. Just keep adding flour slowly and mixing until the dough gets to the point where you can get your hands into it and form it into a ball. The dough should still be rather sticky, but not gooey.  Turn the dough ball out onto a well floured cutting board or counter and start kneading. The kneading works like this: Press your fingers into the center of the dough ball, grab the front of the dough ball and pull it over the top of the depression you just made, press down hard with the heal of you palm, turn the dough ball 1/4 turn and repeat. The idea is to keep stretching and compressing the dough.  Try and do this very quickly. As the dough feels like it might stick, spread a small amount of flour on the surface you're using. If the dough does stick enough to get on the board or your hands you'll need to remove it. Scrape the board with a knife and rub your hands together to remove any stuck dough.  You'll need to add flour a lot, and you want to use as little flour as possible, so try to dust the surface lightly. Keep kneading for about 10-15 minutes. It will get harder to work with after about 5 minutes, but keep at it. Longer kneading will incorporate too much flour, and less won't develop the glutton enough.  Cut the dough ball in half and form each half into a smooth ball by folding the edges into the bottom. Lightly oil two bowls and place a ball in each. Lightly coat the dough balls with oil, cover loosely with plastic wrap, and place both bowls in the back of the fridge. If you want to use the dough ASAP you can let the dough rise out on the counter for two hours rather than putting it in the fridge. But it won't have the same taste and it will be harder to form the pizza.  Let the dough rise in the fridge for several hours or overnight. About 1-2 hours before you're going to top the pizza, take the dough out and let it warm up and rise more. Don't touch the dough yet or punch it down. It should triple or more in size. Preheat the oven to 450 well before you're ready to use it. If you have a pizza stone it will take longer to heat that up completely. If you don't have a pizza stone you can preheat a cookie sheet instead.  Prepare all your ingredients and toppings before you touch the dough. The pizza will have to come together very quickly and you won't have time to chop or mix things. Make the sauce, but don't cook it, just mix the ingredients together. Lay out the meats, chop the veggies, grate the cheese, etc. Get your pizza peel ready by rubbing it with plenty of flour. If you don't have a pizza peel you can use a cookie sheet without a lip, or even a piece of cardboard.  When you're ready to make the pizza, take the dough ball out and pu","wow i cant beleive people really take time to type and answer, long as a novel.........",http://home.centurytel.net/cmptj/pizza/QA.htm,pizza dough dont have as much yeast as bread and is not as full of flavors

windows 98,windows xp,"What are the pros and cons of Windows XP, compared to Windows 98?","having both a windows 98 desktop and an XP laptop at the moment, with similar basic specifications....:

XP Pros:
More stable, easier USB connectivity, better driver support for newer hardware, program compatibility (e.g. such as iTunes, Google Earth, newer releases of Folding at Home), automated security routines, power management (though not entirely perfect), tablet PC version if you have such a beast (like my laptop!), built-in CPU idler for lower temperatures / better battery life / less noise.

XP Cons:
Sheer hardware demand! Bare install on the laptop was about 10gb - I can get 98SE into about 100mb, and I doubt even with pre-install bloatware it'd have been over 300-400. CPU load can be crazy at times, and don't talk to me about how much memory it uses.
Default window scheme looks like an explosion in a toy factory and is even slower. Likes to hide away important ""advanced"" functions behind a glaze of tweeness - basically treats you like an idiot toddler who can't be trusted. Conversely it tries to do far too much stuff automatically as well (tons of ""services"" and other things happening by themselves even when you don't want them to).
Product needs to be actively registered to be used (""activated"") and sometimes this has to be repeated when you change certain bits of hardware.
No MSDOS layer any more, even as an emergency boot option. Does allegedly enhance stability, but has e.g. caused a friend no end of headaches because they can't get at the disc ""raw"" to replace a corrupt system file.
Those bleeding notification baloons on the task bar will drive you insane.
Various stuff like that...

To put it another way:

Win98 Pros:
Very sleek and slick operating system in comparison, appears to do much the same in about a quarter of the hardware (windows 95 is even more efficient, if you need ultimate work-per-cpu-cycle performance). Memory management isn't the greatest, but it works beautifully if you put 512mb in (which is about XP's minimum tolerance level)... it'll never touch the swapfile so who cares if there's the odd leak? Also takes up little CPU time unneccessarily and can be installed in a very small space. Simple window themes don't use much resource.
Nice and simple, and with a couple clicks in a couple of easily found menus can be brought down to almost fully-manual operation. The computer does what you tell it and nothing else.
Still works with USB, albeit with installation of drivers.
Still works a-ok with 95% of programs and hardware (there's not many things you need to do today you didn't eight years ago!).
Cheap or free to get hold of with no activation needed (it's two generations behind)
All problems well known and can be dealt with by established programs. No built in firewall or antivirus, antispy etc, but these can be got easily and for free most of the time. Nothing much new will be cropping up as virus / spyware writers have moved on to XP.
Still has MSDOS for when you need it (recovery, BIOS update, .... and old games!)
Built-in hard disc checking and tidying programs are actually BETTER!

Win98 cons:
Limited or functionality with some new hardware and software. Particularly some USB devices...
No built-in CPU idler - can be hard on the chip (and your ears, electric bill) unless you load one in specifically.
Can be kinda unstable if you're not careful with drivers and shareware programs... unless you're a saint it'll need a reinstall at least once every 5 years.
Bit ugly for some people!

milk,soda,"which will boil faster milk,water,or soda?","Soda will.  Generally speaking, the boiling points of pure substances are going to be higher and sharper than those of impure substances.  In milk, the adulterants are big fatty molecules that are too large to evaporate, and in soda the adulterant is a volitile gas (disolved CO2).  So I think soda first, milk second, water last.

Note; it does matter whether you're looking at ""fastest"" in terms of time to boil based on a standard energy flux/volume ratio, energy/mass ratio, or for the lowest temperature.  Different substances need different amount of energy to reach a given temperature based on their heat capacities, and I believe that milk has the lowest heat capacity, meaning that it would take the least amount of energy to bring milk to a given temperature than it would take for the other two.  But generally, when they ask about ""boiling fastest,"" it is implied that one in searching for the substance with the lowest boiling point--and that would be soda.","Soda will.

A pistol is a firearm designed to be held and fired with one hand.","A rifle is a firearm with a stock and a relatively long barrel that has a spiral groove or grooves ('rifling') cut into the interior. The rifling produces 'lands,' areas that make contact with the projectile (usually a bullet), imparting spin around an axis corresponding to the orientation of the weapon. When the projectile leaves the barrel, the conservation of angular momentum improves its accuracy and range, in the same way that a properly thrown American football or rugby ball behaves. The word 'rifle' originally referred to the grooving, and a rifle was called a 'rifled gun.' rifle (plural: rifles) A firearm with a rifled barrel to improve accuracy.

Basketball is thrilling because the athleticism of players are manifested in this sport. whether you fly high, pass great or shoot the ball with accuracy, you can play the game with fun and finesse. same thing in soccer, the adrenaline is rushing because it is hard to make a goal within the given time. tennis and badminton are quite the same but different because of the ball and other aspects of the game. but both have the same goal. they are great because every play is unpredictable. volleyball is fun too. so as you can see, each sport has its advantages and disadvantages, it is really up to the one who is watching or playing the game. just remember you're playing for the love of the game and for great sportmanship.. that's all kababayan...:D",volley ball ! for some reason I just don;t think were you live is a major tennis center. do you have a female philippines national basketball team ?,soccccccccccccer,god i hate those sports!,none of them  cricket is best,Football!

basketball,volleyball,which do you thinks is better??volleyball or basketball???i like volley but they say that they get paid low?,"Sister, you might have directed this to the guys but I'm compelled to answer anyway.  Look, serious players start fairly young (usually Middle School age for BB and VB).  They play on their school teams and they also play club.  Volleyball club players generally pay in excess of $3K/year in fees, plus more to go to the Nationals (Junior Olympics).  It can be expensive to develop any talent.  Sports are no exception.  Instead of thinking about things way in the future, you need to just decide which sport is best for you and go after it with a passion.

I am a volleyball coach and have taken on many ""projects"" in the past.  That is, people with talent but no skills or experience.  Find a club in your area and see if they'll talk to you about the sport.  Here's a place to start:

http://www.usavolleyball.org/Juniors/

The coaches have seen a lot of players.  Like BB, very few people become professionals.  Do it because it's fun and because you LIKE TO WIN!  If you have the right athleticism and attitude you might make a team.  Don't stop with your first try-out.  Many teams are looking for specific positions.  Study the sport first and understand the roles of each position and which position you might like to play.  When you try-out, tell the coach which position(s) you're interested in.  If they already have a lot of depth in the position you're after, then go try out for another team, and don't take a rejection personally.

Just FYI, many women have had to make a choice between BB and VB.  In particular I'm thinking of Kristin Folkl , who attended Stanford and played both sports.  And she played them well.  Really well.  Olympic well.  Maybe it would be helpful for you to do a Google or Dogpile search on her and study the pros and cons of each sport from her perspective.  Who knows, maybe if you send her fan mail, she'll give you some advice!","Sister, you might have directed this to the guys but I'm compelled to answer anyway.

I have driven the G35 and the 350 and although I had a blast in the 350, the G35 is one of the nicest cars I've driven. I'm older than you, so that may play into that opinion. I have driven a lot of fast cars, and the G is just a great balance of smooth, fast and fun. The G35X is all-wheel drive, which gives it a traction and safety advantage. The A4 is a great driving car and is also available with awd. I've driven several, but I'll tell you... they are expensive to fix and not as reliable as the others. I'd give the IS the edge in looks and luxury. The 350 gets the edge in sporty. But a G35X (second only to an M3 BMW) is my idea of the ideal car.","http://autos.yahoo.com/newcars/comparison/results.html;_ylt=Ar59M_n6eUiox_qBTZWoVgMTc78F?carid0=18601&carid1=18637&carid2=18016&carid3=18303&pagetitle=specifications My first car was a RWD LS sedan. It was really fun to drive but can be dangerousin the winter. If you live in an area without snow, RWD is not that bad. I would perfer all wheel drive but it depends if you want to race in your new car sometimes."
audi,lexus,How does the 2006 Audi A6 compare to the Lexus ES 300?,"The Audi A6 is a purpose-built German sports sedan, which has won the WORLD car of the year award from critics in 37 countries. The ES300 is a rebadged Camry. If he can afford an Audi, only an absolute idiot would even consider going for the ES.

If you were to compare the A6 with a Lexus product, you would want to compare it with the GS series. They are about the same, but I prefer the A6."
audi,lexus,Would you prefer the Audi A3 or the Lexus IS 250?  Why?,"I'd take the A3, though I wish it were RWD. The Audi is more driver oriented than the IS250 and it's functional yet has great handling and power. The IS250 is a nice car but it's too soft to be looked upon as a credible sports sedan.","I'd take the A3, though I wish it were RWD.

bmw,ford,What is best ? BMW 3 Serie or Ford Mustang?,"If just comparing a ford mustang against a BMW then it would have to be the BMW, being a former owner of both I can say that easily. The mustang has many short comings such as brake fade at high speeds, road noise, loose steering at high speeds as well as many more. However the BMW has a few short comings as well higher price tag (but resale is high to), service cost more, aftermarket parts a little more expensive thats about all I can think of. The ride quality in a BMW no matter what series is better than any other car I have owned. And at high speeds lets say 80 MPH you cannot feel the road with a BMW, the mustang gets a little loose. I dont know I would choose the BMW over the mustang any day. But if I had to choose I would wait for the new 2007 toyota supra, or if price is an issue then look at the nissan 350, or if you want good styling then a hyundai tiburon is cool to. Just depends on what you want out of the car. Dont just settle because you think its cool, take into consideration things as a back seat will you need it ever, how much room do you need, gas milage, reliablity, cost think about everything before you buy or else you may be unhappy in the long run.",BMW by far. They are totally different classes of cars.,"I've tried both... and believe me. That is NO comparison. BMWs are way way better than any American car, more so with Mustangs. If I may reiterate - with BMWs, you really feel their slogan, its the ULTIMATE DRIVING MACHINE. The adrenaline rush is there which you will not exchange for any mustang. And Taste wise, you got better taste if you drive a BMW...",bmw i think..,"Ford mustang is a lot better, even though BMW's are expensive as well, they're really shitty cars... believe it or not! I recomend Nissans, toyota's, hunda, and hundei.... If you want to spend your money on something make worth it!",the bmw may cost more but if u are buying new all service is included in the warantyfor 4 years 48k u only have to put gas in it as far as raw horse power goes the mustang has more but it will not hold the road as well as the bmw for normal every day driving the 3 series has more than enough horse power to get around just about anything the gas milage is good to very good i own an m3 that drinks a bit more than the 325 or 330 the ride is smoother and as a nice benefit if u are buying new u can choose to take delivery in spartenburg sc and go through a test track and learn how to drive it go test drive both models and see which one u like best i would suggest that u hit some roads with curves and put some leg into it u will see the difference  for gold dragon u might want to try to tell that to the mustang owners in tampa who try to take on my luxery car and get smoked from 3rd gear on ive left a couple of vettes sitting at the light scratching their heads also,"the mustang, especially the new ones, are more powerful than the three series BMW. BMW's are built for luxuryy, not speed",BMW 3 series mate.. Even James Bond used it,BMW To compare a 3 series to a mustang is like comparing horses to automobiles. Come on!,"The bmw is a lot better car. I have had 2 3 series and have never had a problem that cost over 250 to repair. They get great gas milage, i am getting 33 mpg now. The bmw has better fit and finish on the body panel, interior parts. Ford has guady plastics that dont fit vert well and not very refined. The bmw has a lot better suspension and ride and a more reliable engine. I have found with any car I own that if you take care of them they will take care of you. Any car will become a piece of crap if you dont maintain it. Go to edmunds.com they are a very good auto site where you can read reviews and they rate each car. The guy that likes the ford also recomends a HYUNDIA you buy one of those and it will be worth half of what you payed for it in 1 year, not to mention they are crap and offer no fun factor.","If just comparing a ford mustang against a BMW then it would have to be the BMW, being a former owner of both I can say that easily.

ethernet,usb,What is the difference between an Ethernet modem and a USB Modem?,"How they connect.

Either USB or RJ45 jack

Both will do the same thing.",How they connect. Either USB or RJ45 jack Both will do the same thing.,I would say Eithernet cable all the way!!!   you can alway upgrade the network card fairly cheap   if your ISP allowed it in the future  I am running a network card 100/1000  no problem  only thing is my ISP only goes to 5 meg download   but I got a lot of room to exspand when the ISP does  USB your stuck to 1 speed,There is nothing different between them but most manufacturers provide two methods of connection to your computer. I personally believe ethernet is better. In otherwords if you have a computer without and ethernet card or port you can connect the same modem through your usb port.,"a USB modem plugs into the USB port on your computer an Ethernet modem plugs into the ethernet port on your computer If your computer has both ports available then either modem will work.  Most people find it a little easier to use an ethernet modem if they are planning to install a cheap router with the new modem. If you have a very old computer it may use USB-1 which could, in some cases, limit your rate if you have a very fast connection."

football,golf,don't you know the difference between football and golf?,"Golf (gowf in Scots) is a game where individual players or teams hit a ball into a hole using various clubs, and is one of the few ball games that does not use a fixed standard playing area. It is defined in the Rules of Golf as ""playing a ball with a club from the teeing ground into the hole by a stroke or successive strokes in accordance with the Rules.""

Golf originated in Scotland and has been played for at least five centuries in the British Isles. The oldest course in the world is The Old Links at Musselburgh. Golf, in essentially the form we know it today, has been played on Scotland's Musselburgh Links since 1672, and earlier versions of the game have been played in the British Isles and the low-countries of Northern Europe for several centuries before that. Although often viewed as an elite pastime, golf is an increasingly popular sport that can be played for one's entire life.

American football, known in the United States and Canada [1] simply as football, is a competitive team sport. The object of the game is to advance the football towards the opposing team's end zone and score points. The ball can be advanced by carrying the ball, or by throwing or handing it from one teammate to the other. Points can be scored in a variety of ways, including carrying the ball over the goal line, throwing the ball to another player past the goal line or kicking it through the goal posts on the opposing side. The winner is the team with the most points when the time expires and the last play ends.

Outside of the United States and Canada, the sport is usually referred to as American football (or sometimes as gridiron or gridiron football) to differentiate it from other football games, especially association football (soccer) and rugby football. American football evolved as a separate sport from rugby football in the late 19th century. Arena football is a variant of American football. Canadian football is a close relative to the sport with a few key differences; the word ""football"" in Canada can mean American football or Canadian football depending on context.

Association football, soccer, or simply football is a team sport played between two teams consisting of eleven players each. It is a ball game played on a rectangular grass field with a goal at each end. The object of the game is to score by maneuvering the ball into the opposing goal. Other than the goalkeepers, players may not use their hands or arms to propel the ball in general play. The winner of the match is the team that has scored most goals at the end of the match. The sport is known by many names throughout the English-speaking world, although football is the most common. Other names, such as association football and soccer, are often used to distinguish the game from other codes of football, since the word football may be used to refer to several quite different games.

The origins of football are thought to be over 2000 years old. Indeed, in 2004, football's governing body Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) officially acknowledged that China was the birthplace of football, when people played the sport of cuju around 200 BC. Association football in paticular dervived out of games played at public schools in England in the Nineteenth Century.",I do.

ps3,wii,PS3 AND NINTENDO Wii which one is the best console?,PS3 will be way better.,"The Wii of course.  Just the controller alone makes it better. It has built in motion sensor and a speaker. Can you turn the PS3 controller into a sword to fight with in first person? No. Can you turn is sideways and use it as a steering wheel? No. Can you use multiple controllers at once? No. Not to even mention playing the drums with them. Then there's the hardware. Built in parental controls, and downloadable games reaching all the way back to the original NES games. And with a price tag of $250 compared to a price tag of $600? $250. No shit.","PS3 will be as a computer, so it will be much better","ps3 becasue nintendo wii is some japanese bull and i can't imagine it will be good' Get out. You need to get yourself informed and stop being racist, Sony is a Japanese company too. 'Why? Because Nintendo has only childish games and PSx has games for all ages, you can run games from PS1 into PS2 and I believe it will be the same for the PS3. PSx have many games, more than Nintendo or even XBox.' Are you kidding me? What was your first console, the PS? Nintendo goes back more than ten years before the first PlayStation, you have no idea what the hell you're talking about. Also, you can download a crapload of games from the Genesis, Turbo Grafx, NES, SNES, N64, and play GCN games aside from Wii games. I don't think you know what those systems are considering that you think Sony has more games on their systems than a company that has been making game consoles 10 years before Sony. Nintendo loses in all its consoles because it's kiddy? There must have been a crapload of kids back in 1985 and 1990 because Nintendo won those times. And Nintendo only has games for kids? I guess RE4 was for kids right? And so is Red Steel, Twilight Princess, and Metroid Prime 3? Get out. The PS3 is a better system if you only count hardware. But it doesn't matter how powerful the system is, if it's hard to develop for, more expensive to develop for, and is at an outrageous price for a video game console, then it will get less developer support, which means less games, and not as many high quality games. I'm not saying that the PS3 won't have great games, it has FF XIII, Metal Gear Solid 4, and others, but how long will it last? And also notice how the big games for PS3 are mostly sequels, Final Fantasy THIRTEEN, Metal Gear Solid FOUR, etc. When you want to make a great game on a system as complicated as the PS3, you're taking a big gamble. Your project will take very long, most likely a year or two, and you'll be using a lot of resources. No matter how great the game is, if it doesn't sell well, you'll be losing A LOT of money. That stops a lot of developers from taking big risks on new franchises, and stops small developers from making potentially amazing games, so the industry gets a lot of sequals, rehashes, and spin offs. When there are too many of those, people get tired of those sequals, and potential gamers that haven't played before don't buy games because they would have to play the other games in a series to enjoy the game. Nintendo is heading the right way with their next console, the Wii. Their console is very easy to develop for, because a weaker console is easier to develop for, while a powerful console is extremely difficult and time consuming. That gives developers a chance to make new, original games, and even if it doesn't turn out to be a big success, little to no money will be lost on the project. Because of the price of the Wii, it will be more accessable to consumers, which means more people will buy a Wii, and combined with how easy it is, more developers will make more games, and new games for the Wii. Nintendo just needs to bring up a great launch, and they'll have many developers making outstanding games in the following years.","NINTENDO WII it's got a cool control (shaped like a tv remote) and the control has motion sensors. so lets say youre fighting darth vador. your controller is your lightsaber. aaannnddd, you can download every game ever made for nintendo (even NES!) on it, and some select from Sega and Atari.  and there's an optional joystick you can attach to the bluetooth controller.",PS3 hands down.,"PSx vs. Nintendo, well, Nintendo loses in all of it's consoles. Why? Because Nintendo has only childish games and PSx has games for all ages, you can run games from PS1 into PS2 and I believe it will be the same for the PS3. PSx have many games, more than Nintendo or even XBox. I go with PSx without a doubt.","ps3 will be so much better, idk why but it will",ps3 becasue nintendo wii is some japanese bull and i can't imagine it will be good,"...ps3 might have better graphics, but you know what sony is doing now?  when you buy a PS3, and you plug it in, and you buy a game for your PS3 and you put it into your console, from that point on, after your PS3 starts playing your brand new game, that game will not play on anyone elses system.  you cant take that same game over to your friends house and play it on your friends PS3.  you cant go to the video game store and trade in your PS3 games for other games.  there will be no such thing as used PS3 games, because sony doesnt want any copys of illegal games.  their online gameing network will be a pay-by-the hour thing.  it just sounds dumb.  the wiiii is the way to go!",PS3 will be way better.,THE Nintendo Wii.... the PS3 screwed up big time at E32006 ..so much power yet so little inovation/////Nintendo all the way....,"PS3 is the one that is better. Basically, the price says it. PS3 is going to be $600 while Nintendo will be 'Less than the price of the Xbox360', meaning that it's going to be less than $300. The graphics engines and the speed is going to be better in PS3, and that's the one I will recommend. I see some people saying that the controller for Nintendo is better, but if you're a hardcore gamer like me, you know that the controller is not what we're going to look at. You can get used to a one button controller, even, if the game is good.","The best console depends on what you want from it. For party consoles, the Wii will be better, as it has more controllers, and it will depend more on your skill that button-bashing. Eg Smash brothers mario kart etc. However the PS3 will probably have more famous games eg GTA4, as Sony buys the rights to the brands. So the best console will be your choice of playing style, singleplayer it will be the PS3 multiplayer - almost certainly the Wii.  Both however will have backwards compatatablity so that might push your hand, but honestly how many ps1 games were played on a ps2."
ps3,wii,PS3 vs Nintendo Wii vs XboX360....Which Console Won E3 20006  ???????,"Id say the Wii, it got the most buzz. I don't know how much it's going to be or how will it work with the more complicated games not just the tennis/sports games. Second the XBOX 360 because all the games they showed. The PS3 lost because everyone seems upset with the high price.
We'll see what happends with the price of the Wii ($200?), the final price of the PS3, how many people will pay the high price?, and if the price of the 360 will drop?","Id say the Wii, it got the most buzz.

Nintendo's premise for a new system is simply a gimmick. You wave a wand around and play games on a system that will be far inferior to the other next-gen consoles. Once the novelty of a new controller (which I hear  Sony is developing something similar) wears off, I think its going to turn into a cheap, kids-only console. Technically, Sony beat out everyone with flashy graphics, but then let alot of people down when they announced the price and the cheaper, less-features version. However, the XBox 360 shipped out without HDDVD support (supposedly an add-on for a later date) and a lot of lackluster games. Most reviews say there is very little difference between the XBox games and the 360 games, other than a few graphical enhancements.  So, I say Sony beat them both out, but only marginally."

Also if you like online play, the PS3 will have similar functionality to the XBox 360 for that. But that's if you have an unlimited budget. On a budget, go for the Wii.  It should be $400 cheaper (the good PS3 is $600, no price for Wii yet).  And games should be cheaper (I imagine PS3 games being similar to X360 at $60 while Wii has promised to have mor reasonably priced titles).","Nintendo Wii, the graphics look so sweet!!!",stick with the car you'll probably get more action within it than you playing game consoles. not that i dont like consoles,I watched the E3 coverage and I would get a Wii first.

ps3,wii,"Whats going to be the best? Xbox360, PS3, or the Wii?","""The Wii is a gay *** name""
The NES is a gay name, and that didn't stop tens of millions of people from buying it.

""and the controller is a remote? who thought of that?""
I'm guessing you don't know the full functions of it.

""and the boomerang controller sucks!""
Boomerang was dropped at E3, now Sony has tried to copy the so called remote. If it was such a bad idea, why has Sony tried to copy the functions?

And about Halo 3, one game doesn't make it better than the competition. I could say the same about Super Smash Bros Brawl. If there's one game that can match the popularity of Halo, it's Super Smash Bros.

Well, I think that Xbox 360 will be the best, that's probably the first one that I'm going to get. I don't have much interest in the PS3, but the Wii is different. The 360 has graphics that could be mistaken for PS3 graphics, a proven online system, and a lot of games I'm interested in.

Wii has a very odd controller that sets them apart from the competition, and the ""remote"" has much more features than the Dual Theft. The Dual Theft is limited to tilt sensing, because it has no receiver like the Wii. Also, Wii has Super Smash Bros, Twilight Princess, Metroid Prime 3, Super Mario Galaxy, and a whole bunch of other games that have creative ways of using the controller.

The PS3, I'd get it if it didn't have Blu-Ray. BD-ROM might be a huge leap over DVD, but it's not needed. Oblivion, one of the biggest Xbox 360 games, doesn't even use up half a DVD. And without an HDTV, I see no differences between 360 games, Wii games, and PS3 games.","The Wii is a gay *** name' The NES is a gay name, and that didn't stop tens of millions of people from buying it.

Without Halo, Xbox would have been a giant financial hole and would have seen its production cease.  each will depend upon what games they offer and how fast they can get their games to the market.","360 or Wii, but I hope they don't stick with Wii for the name. If they do, then probably 360. Sony has a foothold in Japan (whereas Microsoft's console has basically no market in Japan), but the Revolution (as I prefer to call it) will make them go nuts and the 360 is doing pretty well here in the states. It also depends on the price of the Revolution, if it's significantly lower than the 360 and copycat PS3 then it could have a serious lead."

Xbox 360 2. PS3 3. Wii I have never really been a fan of the Wii because of the controller.  Flame me later.  I have loved all of the other Nintendos, got the Gamecube and enjoyed it.  Then they came out with the GBA and then they started locking certain parts of games, for example Tingle of Windwaker, or the sticky bomb of Splinter Cell.  Just something, and they did it to sell GBAs.  I hated that, and have not gotten over it.  Now, the mature games come out for Xbox and Playstation while the Gamecube gets mostly Pokemon and Madden Football.  I know it got Resident Evil, but that isn't enough.  I think the Wii will be fun to play, and I am really stoked about the new Zelda game, though I will probably get it for Gamecube.  I am just afraid that the controller will be a gimmick, or that they will make you use it for stupid stuff.  Red Steel looks awesome to play, don't get me wrong, but I won't want to flail my arms around for a couple of hours just to play a game.  However, on a positive note, the idea to play old games is awesome.  Mario 64 and Pilotwings 64, oh how I long for thee. Playstation 1 was an awesome system, the Playstation 2 was not an awesome system.  It had good games, but the system is no good.  2 Controller ports?  Come on.  That was sooo Super Nintendo.  Playstation 3 should be a good system.  Though it looks like they didn't spend much time with it.  The motion sensing controller?  Can't put a rumble feature on it because it will interfere with the motion sensing feature?  Nintendo didn't seem to have a problem with it.  I like the idea of Blu-Ray though.  I think I would rather have that standard win the movie war.  Though they are going to be outrageous for the discs, and the way that they offer movies now, they won't even put the extra space over HD-DVD to use unless you purchase a way more expensive Special Edition of the movie.  I liked how movies were priced about 9 months ago.  They all came with special features and you could get them at a Wal-mart first week they were out for $15.  Now for special features they are like $22-30.  1080p I bet is awesome.  If you have the $600 Playstation 3 (Need HDMI for 1080p, Component only goes up to 1080i) and a new expensive tv for the 1080p input.  Yes, some tv's output in 1080p, but most do not have a direct 1080p input, they achieve that through upconverting 1080i signals.  However, they are offering a robust line up of games, and free online play.  And I am sure the system will be a beast On the case of the 360.  Yes I do own one of these.  And before I get blasted, there is no rule that says I can only pick 1 system forever.  If the PS3 looks to be a great system I can pick it up, along with the Wii.  It does me no good to pick only one system.  The Xbox made some major ground last time around.  This allowed for several things.  First, game companies can now see that if they make games for more than 1 system, they can make more money, so that means that the PS3 will lose some of its more exclusive titles.  Nintendo will get it's Nintendo brand games, but just about everything else for Nintendo is for every other system.  The 360 is more affordable that the PS3, but probably more expensive than the Wii.  The optional HD-DVD is I think a good thing.  If HD-DVD loses the movie war, I don't have to buy it and waste money.  If it wins the war, I can pick up a cheaper next gen movie player.  If Blu-Ray loses, well then..that's just not good for PS3 people, but if they win, sweet deal on the cheap Blu-Ray.  However, you have to pay for online play, and they had a bumpy start on their launch.  My first one messed up, I was without one for almost 2 weeks.  And then I got another one and I am back in business.  The cool stuff about the 360 is stuff that isn't even out yet.  Since Microsoft owns the PC market, and just about everything that goes along with it, they can work on everything being n","1. Wii 2. PS3 3. Xbox-360 I believe that the Nintendo Wii will be the best since it will use new innovated technology like the motion-sensing and controller feedback while keeping the cost of the console down unlike Sony's PS3. But the PS3 will be able to read Blu-Ray disc while Xbox-360 can't read HD-DVD unless you buy an external drive for it which will cost a little more. Most people predict that the Nintendo Wii might cost $199, the same price of every Nintendo's home console launch price."
ps3,wii,"What is the best among X-box, ps3, or nintendo wii?",its hard to answer cuz they all have something unique about them.,"I'm going to say XBox 360, because I've heard that the PS3 will be expensive, and that will be WITHOUT some accessories that you can tack on an extra several thousand dollars for. I'm not sure about the nintento wii, but from what I've seen, it looks like it has more games for kids, as is tradition for nintendo.",nintendo,its hard to answer cuz they all have something unique about them.,Nintendo wii.,probably Wii but i'm gonna buy Wii and PS3.,PS3,"Well honestly the PS3 will be the best, but also the most expensive, if you plan to use it on a HD TV and you watch a lot of movies it is worth it but if you just want the best online play then the 360 is they way to go.

ps3,wii,"Xbox 360, PS3 or Wii who do you think will win the war?","Before E3 I would have said PS3 easily...but after seeing the systems, if you are trying to decide which route to go...better get your budget in mind. Before you even buy a game, the costs for the systems are

Nintendo Wii (new name for Revolution) - $200-$250
XBOX 360 - $400
PS3 - $600

Casual gamers who doesn't care about playing online or HD graphics (and with kids in the house) then the Wii is very attractive.

If you love online gaming, FPS's, great graphics and are okay without Japannesse games (metal gear solid and Final Fantasy) then the XBOX is much more affordable

If you are a graphics wh0re (no shame in that) who has to have the cutting edge technology (no shame in that either) and lots of money, then the PS3 may be your cup of tea.

Personally, I can't imagine spending $600 on a system before a game is purchased (Keep in mind that the $500 version does not have the HDMI or any way to add it on so you will never get the 1080P that they promise). You can actually buy a Nintendo Wii and XBOX 360 for the price of the PS3...wrap your head around that...

Also if Blu-Ray becomes Sony's next BetaMax then the price of manufacturing games and drives for the PS3 will never come down in price...

I have the 360, so I'm going to wait a couple years on the PS3...there won't be enough difference between now and then","Before E3 I would have said PS3 easily...but after seeing the systems, if you are trying to decide which route to go...better get your budget in mind.

ps3,wii,"Which would you recommend: x-Box 360, PS3 or Wii?",Wii is very inovative (ie. not boring) and has the bets game publisher on board: Nintendo,Wii - most innovative gameplay and design plus it will be less than half the price of the cheapest PS3 system.,"PS3 WILL PROBABLY BE BETTER, BUT XBOX 360 IS ASTOUNDING NOW!",Depends on what type of games you like.

ps3,wii,The PS3 is much better than Nintendo Wii which is much better than XBox360. Agree or Disagree?,"Well then, AKU seems to be pretty confident for a fanboy who can't spell.  Your opinions aren't facts, they're hopeless wishes from an idiot who can't think outside of his own ego.

I personally think that the Nintendo Wii is better, because they have more intriguing and entertaining games.  I go where the games are, not which system has more processing power.  The Wii'ss controller will open up many new imaginitive way to play games, rather than pressing buttons throughout the whole game.  I like the way Nintendo is thinking.  Rather than simply upgrading the hardware in the system, they want to implement different ways to play the game.  Almost every feature thay've added to video games have become a standard for all systems.  If it wern't for Nintendo, video games probably wouldn't have lasted longer then the 1980's.  I respect Nintendo for constantly thinking of the customer, not the money.","Well then, AKU seems to be pretty confident for a fanboy who can't spell.

Quite frankly, you're trying to force a really bad comparison without allowance for personal preferences.","It's hard to say... that's somewhat like comparing an apple to an orange.  Nintendo Wii is going to have a completely different game play style than PS3 and Xbox 360 - If you're looking for gfx, go for the PS3, if you're going for new game style and better price go for Nintendo Wii, if you're looking for something you can get now... then obviously get the 360.","I'm answering from what I saw at E3 on G4TV, Nintendo wii is very innovative with gameplay and they showed very cool games, it looks like a lot of fun, but the graphics are just a little better than the gamecube. The Xbox360 have much better graphics, they are just waiting for a killer app and the external HD DVD drive. PS3 I think it was the best thing they show at E3 graphically and they also improved on the controller, example when playing warhawk, the way you move the controller that is the way the plane is going to move. In my opinion The Nintendo Wii is good, the X box360 is great and the PS3 is awsome.","I DISAGREE WITH U WHEN U SAY THAT NITENDO WII IS BETTER THAN XBOX.360, ALSO WHEN U SAY PS.3 IS BETTER THAN NITENDO WII,THEN I AGREE,B'COZ THIS IS ALL THE TRUTH IS... 7GPU [GRAPHIC PROCESSOR UNITS] OF 3.2 GHZ IN PS-3[WHICH WILL RUN SIMOUNTANEOUSLY]. ONLY 3GPU [GRAPHIC PROCESSOR UNITS] OF 3.2 GHZ IN XBOX-360[WHICH WILL RUN SIMOUNTANEOUSLY].

ps3,wii,"please i need to know , which is the best game console to buy  ps3, x360, wii?",i own the 360 and i love it    however when you read info and check out the systems your self   you  may realize like i did that the ps3 is probably your best bet. you have many games to choose from the controller is motion sensitive and i'm sure i don't have to tell you about the graphics.   it's awesome,"Picking a game console solely depends on the type of person you are and what exactly you are looking for.  With the PS3, it does have the best graphics overall, and being it is a blu-ray player as well it means it is capable of making the games longer.  The only thing right now is there are not too many games out for the console.  The Xbox 360 is a great system as well, but I work retail and I see 2 or 3 come back a day due to the fact they freeze. Finally, the Nintendo Wii, brought gaming to a whole different level, it brought interaction, which I believe was a great idea, only thing is the console will only bring about more Childish games then the PS3 or Xbox 360. In my personal opinion, I'd take both the PS3 and Wii.",Its not about the consoles. Look at the games released by each system and then choose the console that has the games you most want to play. ITS ABOUT THE GAMES!!!!!!!!!!! not the consoles.,RIGHT NOW you should get a 360 it had a BIG headstart and has the most games. It had almost a year to fix any problems or whatever with the 360. All the PS3 has is Resistance:Fall of Man and Wii has The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess as their BIG name games. Personally I want all three but the best choice for right now is 360. Just wait a few months to see how well the new consoles can hold up.,i bought them all because everyone has there on opinion and they all are great my favorite so far is the 360.,"Without knowing anything about your gaming habits, I would suggest the Xbox 360 because it has such a head start and therefore, more games to choose from.   Before deciding, consider what types of games you like?  Nintendo is notorious for catering to the younger audiences.  Sony and Microsoft have catered the grown-up gamer.  If you like sports game, I vote for Xbox 360 and PS3.  If you are a fan of an exclusive game property like Zelda, Halo or Gran Turismo, then, I would stick with the console on which the game appears.  If like all kinds of games, save your money because you will need it for all three!",Therer is one thing you should know about the wii it is an overclocked gamecube.,"The wiiiiiiiiii. It different from other as in you are more active in moving around and controlling the game-not just sit there and press on controller. And it much cheaper too, more fun as a group game. so get the wiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii",i own the 360 and i love it    however when you read info and check out the systems your self   you  may realize like i did that the ps3 is probably your best bet. you have many games to choose from the controller is motion sensitive and i'm sure i don't have to tell you about the graphics.   it's awesome,PC.  /thread

I'm going to wait awhile before making my decision..",the wii because you can download the older games like the first metroid and the first mario. i like it becuase you can play the cube games with the wii with the cube controlers.,"euh, wii is more fun... its pad make it feel near reality thought its graphics is not of high quality compared 2 ps3...","Wii!

They might even direct you down the hall, to the left.","ITS ALL ABOUT THE WII BABY!!!!! I MUST GET A WII, haHa that does sound funny!!!!",It is a matter of opinion! But if you mean like speed and graphics then PS3 is better. But if you want my opinion? Buy the Wii! Sony made a big mistake when they made the PS3! It is expensive. They will lose about 250 $ for every console sold and they really need to sell many games too make up for the loss.  e.g. if they make a 10 $ profit on each game sold they need to sell 25 games just to get even,PS3 is technicaly more powerful... but who cares?  The Wii is much more fun and interactive.  There is no way to justify the price of the ps3,"They are completely different.  The wii is a move in the direction of improving the user interface, while the PS3 focuses on graphical power.  There is no definite better console.  It all depends on your preferences.","You can't really compare the two in my opinion. They are two totally different consoles.  The Wii is truly next generation gaming. It is the first game console released that focuses on virtual reality. For instance, if you are shooting, you are actually holding the controller as if it were a gun.  The PS3...same thing as the PS2 (and every other video game console), only better graphics, more memory, and the chip that allows parents to control what their kids play.",all around i think the wii

However, not being a Nintendo fan myself for all these years the Wii definitely gets the COOLEST bonus for the nanchuk controller... I mean seriously - the kids are already jumping up and down as they play tobegin with, this very awesome controller really takes gamming to a new high!

ps3,wii,Do I buy the Wii or the PS3 for my husband?,"It sounds like your husband is a Nintendo fan based on his systems so far. He will definitely enjoy the franchises Nintendo has to offer, especially the new Zelda being released with the console. Thats the closest thing Nintendo has to an RPG so far but there's good news. Square Enix, the people responsible for those Final Fantasy games had an exclusive deal with Sony for the last generation of systems which does not apply for this generation. So expect RPGs in the future for the Wii. If your kids like shooters, there is no better system than the Wii. Where you point the remote is where you shoot. Nintendo recently has been focusing on getting non-gamers involved. The Wii has channels you can browse that display the weather, the news, a place to store and view photos/home movies from a digital camera (The memory is an SD card just like in digital cameras.) and even a message board where you can leave your sons or husband a message for the next time he turns on the console. It also has a feature known as virtual console where for $5, $8, or $10 he can put some of his old favorite Nintendo, Nintendo Famicon, Nintendo 64, and Sega games on his Wii.

       If Nintendo follows the same trend they have for the new gameboy, Nintendo DS, it's about giving you innovative games at an affordable price. People have posted earlier about the Wii costing more in the long run. Let's break that down. First you have the Wii at $250 for a system. The PS3 will retail for $500-600 depending on if you want the full package or not. Right off the bat, the PS3 is $250 more than the Wii in the best case scenario. Games are what you buy the most of for a system, and the Wii has the cheaper price for their games at $50. Compare that to PS3's $60 per game and that $250 more you spent on the PS3 increases by $10 for every game you buy. As for the controllers, a full Wii controller costs $60 and a PS3 $50. 1 comes with each console so you will only need to buy 3 at the most. The only other cost in the systems are for memory. As I mentioned earlier it uses SD cards and I highly doubt you can manage to fill $250+ worth of SD memory it would take to make the Wii ""Cost more in the long run.""

First off, the Nintendo game systems have been far behind that of microsoft and playstation from the very beginning.  Graphics and games are too cartunistic.  Xbox360 I will agree is a great game console.  I have played many of the games for it and yeah they are really good.  Gears of war is an okay game. I mean it has okay graphics, but overall I feel it is overrated.  The ps3 will becoming out with blu ray capabilities.  Blu ray will soon replace dvd's, as high definition.  Which is like dvd's on crack.  It will be the cheapest blu ray player for quite some time.  You will be able to play ps, ps2, and psp games on it.  Games will never go bad on the ps3.  The new games are going to be expensive but this is because there will be 10 layers of enamel on the game.  Which makes it practically impossible to scratch.  I believe these features alone makes the system at least half a generation better than xbox360 and the Wii.  It will have internet capabilities built in.  What this whole battle basically comes out to is games.  If your into halo, I am, halo 3 is enough of a reason for people to buy it.  If you like games like metal gear solid 4 or GTA the ps3 is the way to go.  Personally I'll take a ps3.","I say you sould get an Xbox360, cuz that's the only one I've ever heard of! LOL! I don't know much about gaming systems, if that's what you call them!","I think PS3 and Xbox360 is a tie. And the tie goes to the cheaper system...The 360. The graphics are almost the same. Plus you can get the 360 without camping. Get the PS3 a lil later. Trust me about 1 out of 5 ppl will get the PS3 since Sony will only ship 400,000 units to America. The 360 last year had about 1.5 million. The Wii this year will ahve 1.5 million to.  Also everyone is crazy about the PS3. If you havent preorder, theres no luck of u getting one. I would get the 360 now before they run out which usually happens around December. Bottom Line: Xbox 360","in my opinion the ps3 is much better, the new blue ray discs can store 10 times that of a dvd, and it has connections in the back that allow you to hook up multiple tv's and play games. the xbox 360 is nice but it's already out and that gave ps3 the time to upgrade and add changes, the nintendo wii looks pretty cool, with the controller especially."
ps3,wii,should i buy the xbox360 or the ps3 or the nitendo wii?,The Xbox also has a hard drive. If you have has one of the console game before it would be worth the money to buy the same one to play all of your current games.,"The XBox 360 has a hard drive... But if all you care about is additional features and power, rather than original features, and if money is no object, and you can wait for it's release - get a PS3.",um a ps3 is good but the wii is even better!! i have both and i like the wii better!!,The Xbox also has a hard drive. If you have has one of the console game before it would be worth the money to buy the same one to play all of your current games.,interested in a Wii?  go to www.ebay.com i'm selling two under: *dealsbeyond*
ps3,wii,"what is the best of the 3 game units, 360, ps3 or wii?","In all honesty each system has its own merits to consider. I believe there is no ""best"" overall, just best for personal tastes. 

360: Has more games available for next-gen and has been market tested being out for over a year now. Graphics are very good and the controls are decent (always liked the more trigger like buttons then they have on ps2/ps3). Content wise is more suited to mature gamers with exceptions such as Viva Pinata, and the children's games like Cars and Open Season. Tag on a genre to the system, those who like shooters and sports will be more open to the Xbox 360 then the others. 

PS3: This system boasts high end graphics like the 360 but fall short in some aspects. While it does support a higher resolution then the 360 can with HD and a built-in HDMI connection, the 360 is getting a patch in a time to support the higher 1080p/i. Though in honesty no system looks the best when it launches so cannot be easily compared to the 360 till the PS3 has had at least a year of development. They stuck with same basic design as the PS2's Dual Shock controllers though they removed the vibration to add there own motion control dubbed ""Sixaxis"".(To my, and many other gamers disappointment). With built in Blue-Ray technology it allows for high-def movies out of the box and comes cheaper then a standard on the market Blue-Ray player. Though many people think Blue-Ray will go the way of UMD movies (its too early to tell till it becomes a more prominent media) the bright side is since the system is default with the player, all PS3 disks can contain much greater data sizes compared to a standard DVD that the 360 uses. If you placed a genre to the PS3 it would be medium, focusing on sports but adding alot of action adventure and RPG's that the 360 lacks (or at least will within the year of the systems launch.)

Wii: Nintendo's new system is hard to compare to the other two. PS3 and 360 are much more graphic intensive, boasting true Next-Generation graphics. They are powerful high tech equipment that can rival some super computers. The Wii on the other hand uses more current and past technology, such as utilizing the Gamecube's basic tech and upgrading it slightly. The graphics, while cant compare to the other two are good in there own right. What sets the Wii apart is its next-gen game play. The Wiimote and the nunchuck attachment are fully motion sensitive, and while they only have 3 axis compared to the PS3's 6 axis, the Wii is gonna use much more motion since most games will be designed around it. Nintendo made the system so that doing other gaming types, such as playing baseball, shooting a gun, swinging a sword, driving a car, feels more natural then previous ""button mashing"" games have been in the past. With only a few buttons on either controller, most games will be free-form in terms of control. Also the Wii is the only 100% true backwards compatible next-gen system. it can play every gamecube title, and has 4 gamecube controller ports, 2 GC memory ports. It can use all accessories minus 3: Gameboy Player, Modem Adapter, Broadband adapter. But it does come default with a built in wireless network (similar to the DS's wifi). It comes with the least memory then the ps3 or 360 with only 512megs of internal flash memory but has an expandable SD flash memory stick port on the front. (Though nintendo game saves never were too large). Also the Wii will boast the Virtual Console, the ability to download NES, SNES, N64, Sega Genesis, and TurboGraph 16x games, with 30 titles of Virtual console games available at launch and more to come that's pretty decent, though it will cost $5 to $10 to download per game based on its platform. Also N64 downloaded games will not feature rumble support. To rate the genre of the Wii its more of an everyone system. Boasting more children games then the other two, it is slowly expanding from being a ""kids"" system to a much ","Depends on the games i guess, For me ill go with ps3 since i am looking forward to playing ffxiii and GT5","For mine ps3 is the coolest because of the graphics, and more it's like ur home theater. and the second xbox 360 and wii.wii its not good because the beautiful on wii is just only the remote the graphics and the gameplay its not cool.360 its the graphics only for me. I gonna buy ps3. Just go buy if u want",xbox 360 : games ps3 : graphics wii : controller,"I personally think the Nintendo Wii is the best. It is now Virtual Reality. And the graphics are as good as a PS2. Im getting a Wii before and XBox360 or PS3. And, The Wii's price is alot cheaper too. PS3-$600, XBox360-$400, Wii-$250. The Wii's games are cheaper too, and also you can go online and play PS3 games, XBox360 games, SNES, NES, Nintendo 64, and the Wii is compatable with GameCube games. The Wii's my choice. Also, you can download updates to games even when the system is turned off! How Cool!!! Get the Wii, it's better",well i think that the wii and 360 are the best. im getting them for my b-day and hannukah i think that the PS3 is an overpriced version of the PS3. the wii has the awesome controler and the 360 has a ton of games and will be easier to get. the PS3 thought will be very hard to get and u might have to wait till like march or something like that or u shouldve camped out. but all of this depends on what u like. i think u should get a wii and a 360 because together they are like almost the same price as a PS3. hope this helps,"In all honesty each system has its own merits to consider.

nintendo wii is kinda a mix... a kidish like game system and an adventure(cars, mario, fighting)","I prefer a PS3 but i don't know about you. If u want a teenish and adventure like games and racing PS3 If u like shooting killing and other mature games is xbox 360 nintendo wii is kinda a mix... a kidish like game system and an adventure(cars, mario, fighting)",360 is the best hardware. It all comes down to the games in the end. The 360 is much easier to develop for than the PS3. The Wii doesn't belong in the same discussion as it does not have next gen graphics.,"PS3... its a year newer than the 360... PS3 is $100 cheaper if you consider all the next gen tech such as Wifi and HD Disk PS3 has 8,000+ backwards compatable games 360 has 150+ sort of backwards compatable games"
ps3,wii,"which will be better, PS3, Xbox 360, or nintendo wii?","Personally, I think the Nintendo Wii will be the best console to get, because out of the three it is the only one that is going forward with technology. 
Yes, the 360 and PS3 have nice graphics but what is the point of good looks if underneath you are essentially playing the same old, same old...
The 360 and PS3 just follow on from their predecessors, but with more power and better graphics. You are still playing the same games, in the same way... only now you are playing them with better visuals...

Great!

The Nintendo Wii offers a totally different way of gaming, putting you more in control - what you do is interpreted on screen.

People criticize the machine for having less power than Xbox or PS3 but of all the screenshots and video footage released so far, the graphical capability is just as good as those machines. The difference is in the controls, and that is where the Wii stands out. 
You will play Xbox and PS3 with the standard control pads but the Wii has sensor pads which are one step away from virtual reality - you move the pad, your character moves - easy as that!

As for release dates and prices, well, not sure where you are but this is the situation in the UK:

Xbox360 is already released, and sells at roughly £250-280 depending on whether it is bundled with a game or not.

Nintendo Wii is released on the 8th December and is priced at £179. It comes with a free multiplayer game called Wii Sports.

The PS3 is expected to be released March 2007 at a staggering price of £430!

So, as regards to your Son's Christmas present, it looks like a contest between the 360 and the Wii.

Besides, there won't probably be enormous technical differences. Microsoft's X-Box is too expensive and you can expect the Nintendo Wii to cater to its own fan base (Nintendo has always had a reputation for being a bit different). Also, your son will be able to experience a lot of new and exciting games right from the start, which doesn't always happen with Nintendo or Microsoft (it may take a while they find their own killer app). I collect game consoles and in my own experience, the Playstation, no matter what number, is the best entertainment system to come down the pike in decades.","all three are already out xbox 360 has been out for around a year now, i have one i have heard alot of complaint on them messing up and stuff, ive only had one problem with mine so far and i sent it to microsoft and they sent me a new one back within a week...the 360 cost around 399.00 for the loaded one ps3- good luck finding one, it just came out and probably wont find one till after the new year unless you wanna spend around 1500.00 on ebay...i dont know much about the yet but i think sony took extra precaution to get out all the bug, so in my opinion there will be less flaws with the ps3 than the xbox. i think retail is 599.00 for the ps3 the wii, i first heard it was gonna suck, after seeing reviews on it, i  think it will be a good gaming system, i think its running alittle under 300.00 bucks, but doubt you'll be able to find one of those either till after christmas because it just came out too...good luck and happy hunting","Wii is best. PS3 is too much money, XBOX 360 has no good games, it's not worth it.",the wii isn't a next generation gaming system... it's just got a cool way of doing stuff!! XBOX 360 kicks ass... although many of the games are adult. Wii is only 180 quid with games... so i'd go for that one! (it's out on December 8th),"In terms of game play, ease of use, graphics etc/....... then the PS3. The little Wii is a great toy but only you can decide weather or not you like the control system for it... As for XBox, I hat e them, built by Microsoft, not as powerful as PS3, between the two consoles. Plus you can only play HD DVD on XBox and not Bluray and experts are saying, Bluray is the HD DVD of choice, backed by the biggest film produces and has the potential for far greater use.",Get a free console http://www.consolegrab.co.uk/?r=78268...,PS3 more power than xbox and the control on some games is a bit like the WII remote,"OK, I've been a Nintendo nut since I got my first Gameboy about 15 years ago. Zelda, Mario and Metroid are all great games that you won't find on XBox or PS3.  Wii offers a new and unique way to play games.  It plays Gamecube games and the facility to download SNES and N64 games will be available. It's also the cheapest, smallest and best-looking console.  It doesn't have as much muscle as the othe two, but it's games that count.  It's out a week on Friday. Nintendo have struggled with their kiddie image against the cooler Microsoft and Sony consoles, but I  think they'll shake that image off with Wii.   Buy one.  I will be.","they are coming out around now, price ranges from £250 to £450 and they are all virtually the same, but most people will want the ps3, its the most popular","Xbox 360 have been out for a while, the Nintendo Wii is out on the 8th of Dec and the PS3 is out next march i think, personally im waiting for the PS3 but the Xbox 360 has got some awesome games on it to, call of duty 3, gears of war, pro evolution soccer 6 to name a few.","they are all great I want all 3, for christmas I got my husband a ps3.","It all depends on the games.  I like the games that are coming out for the xBox, Gears of War and Halo, Halo-2 and Halo-3 (in 2007), are exclusive to xBox.  PS3 is a better machine but what good is a better machine that won't play the game you want to play? The other thing is the Hi-Def format.  Sony is going with the Blue-Ray (they helped to make it) and xBox with the HD-DVD.  I think that HD-DVD will win out for a several reasons, the main one being that the name has HD and DVD in it.  This will go over better with consumers.","The PS3 isn't out until march in the UK. Between the 360 and wii I'd go for a 360.  Mature, online play and HD gameplay for your spanking HDTV! However if your son is younger than 10 you might want to get the wii which is more about creative play than chucking grenades at terrorists. The most useful thing you can do is find out what type of tv he likes. If he's into kids cartoons go for a Wii, if he's into sports, 24 or Battlestar go for a 360. Cost:  Xbox360 basic £199 Nintendo Wii £179 and one more time for those in the US: the PS3 isn't out until march in the UK. Also the hardware isn't practically superior to the 360, it costs a bundle more than the 360 and sony are just as unethical as microsoft but they have better advertising. Between the 360 and PS3 the only real factor is the quality of the exclusive games.","PS3 will be the ultimate but at the mo, x-box 360 is doing it. The Wii looks good but its about what games are coming out on it."
ps3,wii,"Which one is the best PS3,Wii,or Xbox 360?","I really am not in a position to say because I don't actually own any of the 3. But I can say that I have played alot on the xbox 360 and enjoy the smooth graphics and the controls are awesome! It also has a ton more games to choose from at this point. W/ the backwards compatibility the options are endless. (But the price of games and accesories is a bit high right now!)

PS3 seems to me, from what I've read and heard, is a cool system IF you're buying it too watch movies. Only a hand full of games are out for it right now, but when it comes out w/ more good games I will probably like it more. And also I thought that even without a rumble pack the graphics would compinsate! BOY I sure was wrong. With out a rumble pack it is almost hard to tell when you are getting shot at or hit! As of right now I'd say it looks pretty lame. (I was a bit dissapointed by what I have read and heard).

Wii!!!! This system looks promising! They already have a few great games out and the controls look like fun. (I have a friend who got to play on one over the summer when he worked for E3. He said that if he had never had any video game expirence the Wii would have been a lot of work to play w/. He said you can get a work out! lol) The low price of the Wii should also make it one of the top sellers. 

Personally I like the xbox 360 the best at this point cause I can't wait for HALO 3!!!! Lost Planet is another game that looks promising. I am waiting for the price to drop a bit on the Xbox 360 before I purchase it though.","The ps3 will be the Best, But for right now the 360 is on TOP ! For one thing the ps3 isn't fully compete and it can't play a lot of the older games nether.

It has fun games with different ratings while the Ps3 and xbox360 have the same games everytime. All of their games are rated mature and they all have to do with Shooting, Wars, and fighting. The Wii comes with all genres of games. I tried the motion sensing controller and it was fun and easy to use. If you like shooting games, you could use the controller as a gun and point it at the screen like the gun in the original Nintendo. You could also browse the internet, download pics from your digital camera, send messages to other people, download classic games online, and play gamecube games on it. Wii is the cheapest system and the most fun to play. Its the obvious choice.","ps3 is probably the most expensive, the wii is awswome, and 250 bucks, the controller is sick. the xbox 360 is pretty good too"

WII,dude i have to say wii is better just because im a big nintendo fan but Playstation 3 looks good too.,"My Opinions (Who could have anything else?) The PS3 is better thant he 360. It is expensive, but the fact that it was sold out months after launch proves that people will be willing to buy it. The 360 sold horribly in Japan where people were mostly waiting for Sony to get its console out. Sony has made it easier to acess their disc technology (Blu-ray) by packaging it with the console. 360 owners will have to buy an attachment for HD-DVD. The Wii deserves to be left out of that clash of the titans. It wants nothing to do with the markets Microsoft and Sony are going after and will do very well as an independent console. My predictions in 5 years: Everybody will own a Wii (at $250, why not?) and the 360 will be dead with Blu-Ray reigning as the new VCR.","Definately the Wii.  XBox 360 and PS3 are way too expensive, have no good games that are exclusive to the system, and are innovative for all the wrong reasons (I mean, come on, unless you've got the money for an HDTV, what's the point of Bluray?  Which by the way is not a very established format).  The Wii has new game control, sweet games like 'Twilight Princess' and 'Red Steel,' and goes for only $250 a pop.  Oh, and did I mention that Wii is the only system that's completely backwards-compatable (you can play all the Game Cube games on it)? If you've got money to burn and you're looking for super hi-def, usual gameplay, go for PS3 or Xbox 360 (there should be some good games eventually).  But for practicality's sake I would suggest the Wii.",Id have to say Xbox360 currently
ps3,wii,Wii vs PS3. What do you think is better?,"I saw the Wii and I agree on the controller, that makes it pretty cool",I like Wii because my son is actually doing something instead of just sitting there. You can also creat avitar like people to appear in your sport games. I think the PS3 looks just like the PS2 and from what I hear they are already having problems. Lots of glitches.,Wii,wii because of the price and motions sensing. also i grew up with a super Nintendo and i have always played Nintendo games,another benefit to the wii is that you can use your gamecube games also so it's not a lost cause to the gamecube and i probably won't get shot over it.,"I saw the Wii and I agree on the controller, that makes it pretty cool",PS3 is better...it actually has a normal controller and you can play norml games on it. the 'Wii' looks like it a piece of shit. oh wow you have a remote controller for the joystick....woo woo.....I don't think the 'wii' is going to be as successful as the Playstation three.,I  like the ps3 but for what it cost its not worth it!

The Wii has only the graphics of the regular Xbox and once you strip away it's controller function you're left with a fancy looking box. The Xbox 360 is nice and has great graphics but once you take away the games there isn't much you can do with it. The PS3 is the most up to date, and the various USB functionalities and BlueTooth features allow it to be the BEST!",PS3 has a lot of best game,"honestly these are all good systems.  Arguably the best console is Sony.  it has prestige, the graphics, and haha the high resale value.   360 is well rounded.  it has the advantage in terms of games.  more affordable.  graphics are sweet.   wii is innovative.  unique to say the least.  it looks fun.   I wish i could buy em all.  but ps3 is sold out way too high. wii is not meant for me.  360 is my choice!!!!!","Although I'm not a big Nintendo fan, I will probably buy the Revolution(Wii). Why? Well it's the cheapest one. And my wife is looking forward to Zelda. I guess she's worth $250. I collect guns, and just paid $800 for one accessory, so I think she's worth it. Already have a 360 and love it! Flush the PS3!","The Wii is Nintendos dying breath.  If you listen carefully you can hear it.  It's a pathetic gaming console not worthy of mentioning with the 360 or PS3. Whoever says the PS3 will have better graphics then the 360, you've got another thing coming.  The differences are neglible (and depends on each individual game and the games engine) and who has the better graphics is argueable. Xbox has cornered the market in on-line gaming and Playstation doesn't have a chance in catching up.  PS missed that boat and is floundering in the open water.  The on-line gaming community that Xbox has set up is simply beautiful. Blue ray technology is overrated, expensive to produce and impossible to copy.  HD is the short term winner and the 360 will play them with the new HD component.  PS3 will not. PS3 has a bunch of Japanese Anime games to offer.  Xbox has cult icons like Halo 2, F.E.A.R. and Gears of War out right now.  And Halo 3 comes out in 2007.  Once again Xbox will have the most popular game in gaming history.  And Playstation will be left behind.  Go buy a 360.",The Wii. Its a new gaming experience.... motion-sensitive controls... Red Steel... pure genius! Whats more is that its cheap! Compared to the PS3... ($600? you've got to be kidding....),PS3. An open technology so that another decade and still you would be uptodate. Rest are obvious
ps3,wii,"Which is better the wii, ps3, x_box 360?","I have always been a fan of the playstation and my bias answer would be the PS3. But the thing is that I've played the 360 and I have to say that it's a pretty nice system. The graphics are amazing and you can also change the color of the faceplate. lol. It's just a little extra if you want it to match your room or something like that. The 360 is also more internet based, so if you like to play online games, the 360 would be the consol for you. ^^

I havent' played the Wii yet but from what I've heard, it's pretty fun because of the fact it's motion sensored. Makes you get up and literally ""play"" your game. It's also a good value, only 250 dollars. The graphics are pretty good too.  

The Ps3 is a powerful system also, I think it may be up there with the 360 graphics-wise. I've seen some game previews that were on the PS3 and they were awesome. I couldn't tell the difference between GC movies and the in-game graphics. haha. 

What I suggest is to get the consol that goes with your gaming style. If you enjoy online gaming and shooters, then a 360 is for you. Nintendo has always catered to the younger crowds and their games have always been adventure-based, like Zelda and Mario for example. The PS3 isn't very much online but more single player in my opinion, and has the Final Fantasy series (a great RPG series by the way ^_^). 

I hope I've helped a bit on your console decision. :)","Ok so you wanna know what system is the best of the next generation systems huh? Well consider this: Nintendo has been, currently is, and always will be the king when it comes to ease of use and fairly simple straight forwardness. All of Nintendos games and systems are fairly straight forward and usually have the fewest buttons and controls. Thier games are also some of the best as far as playability, so you can catch on fairly quickly. And a cool thing is that with the Wii's motion sensor capabilites they are goign to be brinign back some of the older games like Duck Hunt, and they will even give you a gun albeit a little revamped but thats still gonna be cool. The Sony has always been known for its RPG's, that is role-playing games. Games like Final Fantasy and .Hack which are very long very drawn out games involving multiple discs. And Sony is getting even better moving to Blu-Ray with the PS3 which means they will be able to put even longer more involved games on thier discs increasing the play time you have. Now the X-Box systems are the newest and least tested of the platforms. So far we've seen games like Halo 2 and GuitarHero exclusivly with the X-Box 360 and these games have procurred a cult following very fast. X-Box 360 has arguably some of the best graphics of a system out-to-date as it is most like a computer, and therefore can run better graphics. But I can assure you that the X-Box 360 is just the beginning of the new generation of systems. So the best system all depends on what you are looking for in the game. For old school games with fairly easy playability go with the Wii and at $250 you wont break the bank, but you might not get anythign outstanding either. For extended play time and indepth plots that will have you playing for days and even weeks go with the PS3 and at $600 you might need to wait for the price to drop some or buy it on E-Bay xD. Or for stunnign graphics and popular games go with the 360 but since there are two versions that means two prices so $300 - $400 not terribly exoensive but none to cheap either. Hope this helps - Josh",i would say ps3,"I have always been a fan of the playstation and my bias answer would be the PS3.

If you already have a PS2 then it is really no use and you should just get a Wii. I don't think you should get an X_box 360 out of these three though.
ps3,wii,"what is better a wii,gamecube,xbox,xbox 360,gameboy SP,PSP or PS3?","Mainly a matter of personal preference, but I'll go ahead and spec it out for you....

First of all, I'm going to ignore the price...

Wii - Plays GameCube games, you can also download GameCube games from the Wii, as well as NES, SNES, N64, MegaDrive/Genesis, PC Engine/ TurboGrafx-16.  See http://tinyurl.com/yjrrcq for more information.  Also, the controller is a biggie on this one, it's got motion sensing technology far beyond the PS3's.

Gamecube - No reason, disregarding price, to get this one since the Wii plays all GameCube games, and more....

Xbox - It's probably a good idea to get this if you have (or have access to a TON of Xbox games, including ones that aren't on this list: http://tinyurl.com/bfzxt ) Or, if you can't hook your Xbox 360 up to the internet.

Xbox 360 - Get this one if you have, or like original Xbox games (once again, only the ones listed here will play: http://tinyurl.com/bfzxt )...this system does offer 1080i/p hi def TV, as well as 720p, and 480p, and of course, regular def.  There are two packages of the Xbox 360, essentially, they are the same systems but the $300 version is stripped down...to see a comparison, go here: http://tinyurl.com/ydjr48.

Gameboy Advance SP:  Well, it's really hard to compare this to the PS3 or any console, really, not worth getting in my opinion.

PSP - It's okay, you can run third-party software on it, and better than the GBASP, not to mention you can get on the internet.

PS3 - It looks promising, it's got all the features the 360 does, plus integrated wifi, and a 6-axis tilt controller.","1.xbox 360 or ps3 2.wii better graphics,technology, everything...  newest as well but its all opinion really",Okay...

ps3,wii,"which do u like better PS3,wii, or xflop.?","PS3. Sony=love, without a doubt. I love how hardcore Xbox 360 fans are boasting that the 360 is the best one because it's already out. If you'll remember, that little fact came with its own load of setbacks. Remember all of the defective systems that had been released? What a shame; especially considering how much they cost. Newsflash: the PS3 isn't going to be that much more expensive than the Xbox 360. And when you consider that it's an upgrade....well, of course it's more expensive. Don't like it? Well, no one is forcing you to buy one, are they?","Xflop?  What's an xflop? Ohhh you're trying to slam the Xbox 360--the only next-gen console that's already out, already has great games, has better ones coming, and doesn't cost you two arms and a leg to get it.  In addition, the 360's graphics will be comparable to what the PS3's graphics will be (the PS3's will be better, true, but not by that much)--but graphics have never been anything near the deciding point of a system for me in the first place. So 'xflop' all you like, but we'll be the ones laughing when Sony has to revamp its entire PS3 line because no one can afford the system--or its accessories--or its games. ~Scottie",The Wii looks so effing stupid. Xbox 360 is actually really cool. I prefer Playstations though. I can't wait for the PS3.,"PS3. Sony=love, without a doubt.

It doesn't solve anything, it doesn't persuade anybody to buy anything different because 90% of retail purchases are based off impulsive decisions.  Let me ask you a different question: How many people in here know exactly how the PS3, Wii, or Xbox 360 work?  How do you differentiate between which one is the best 'videogame' console, not entertainment, not music, not movies, not pictures, VIDEOGAMES! And then the final question how many people in the past have paid over 600 dollars for a videogame console?

ps3,wii,"X360, Wii, or PS3: Which looks the best now and later?","in the long run the PS3 will probably come out on top.  Sony has established itself as the clear leader in the video game market for both of the last two generations of console gaming systems.

They have established and maintained long term relationships with developers of some of the most popular gaming franchises out there.

Even though Sony will come out on top, I think there is still plenty of room for the Xbox and Wii to prosper.

The xbox has really cornered the market with online gamers, while Nintendo has always dominated the under 12 age group.

All three will survive and have their strengths and weakness, find the one that has the most of the type of games you like and go with it.

Or be like me and get all 3!","I think all three have staying power. I just bought the Xbox 360 and it has some great games (just recieved 'Gears of War' and the gameplay and graphics are outstanding), excellent online play, and later this month microsoft will give you the option to download movies and shows to your xbox. I think Playstation 3 is also a great system but we will have to wait and see untill it comes out. Wii is different and unique which is why I might buy one in the next few months. In any case all three are great systems. Sorry I coulden't be of more help.","in the long run the PS3 will probably come out on top.

Its the most innovative: the Wii controller is revolutionary.  Ps3 meanwhile is the same old controller since 1995, and it doesn't even have rumble anymore! Its got everyone excited, even devolopers: just look at all the launch titles, 62 launch titles!!! what does PS3 have, like half a dozen titles?  Developers are much more excited over the Wii because its they make more profit and its easier for them to make stunning games. Back-catalogue:  The Playstation can't hold a candle to the Wii's virtual console.  The potential library for the Wii can include any game ever made for the NES, SNES, Sega Genesis, Tubrografx16, N64, and possibly even the Saturn and Dreamcast.  Thats every system ever made!  Believe, publishers definently want to collect on games that are sitting collecting dust, it costs them next to nothing! First and Second Party Games!  Nintendo is the king in this category.  Who can say no games like Mario Party, Smash Brother, Mario Galaxy, Zelda, Donkey Kong, Metroid, StarFox and the list goes on and on and on....  The Wii is going to win hands down, and thats besides the fact that for the proce of one PS3 with no games ($600) you can own a Nintendo Wii with 8 games!!!"
ps3,wii,"Whats game system is better for all around Entertainment PS3, XBox360, or The Wii.?","Well, I've asked this question many times before .. and after a couple of months of reading reviews, messages boards and the systems tech info .. in MY opinion, 1. XBOX360, 2. Wii and 3 PS3.
Why I say this .. in the hardware department, the 360 vs. PS3 are basically the same, with some going with a the better architecture for the 360 and others (but few in comparison) to the PS3. But again, basically they are the same. One difference would be the integrated Blue Ray DVD that is already included on the PS3. But, at least for me, that doesn't make any difference, I really just don't care for Blue-Ray DVDs. XBOX360 has an ADD-ON Blue Ray DVD thingy, which you can get for around 200$ (I think), so it's basically the same price. 
The Wii is a fairly simple console, with the ""fun factor"" to the max, but seriously left behind on the hardware race (graphics and such).
I, personally after pondering this question, decided to get a 360, just because I wanted to get the best console and best price. The Wii, in my opinion, is a great console, but I decided NOT to buy one when I saw the 250$ price tag (I really think that the price should have been 149.99 - 199.99 no more than that). 

So, overall, for me the best console for entertainment (because of the hardware+fun factor+price) is the 360.

But if you have the money buy an Xbox360 + a Wii .. OR a PS3 + Wii. Only this way you might get the best of both sides of gaming .. kick ass graphics and incredible fun.","The Nintendo Wii is the best, but XBox has the most....'gadgets'.",I believe the Xbox 360 is the overall best. It's winning so far in sales. Xbox then wii and PS3 is coming in last so far.,"it depends what you want and who you are.. if you're a child, you'd probably like the Wii..  if you want to buy a lot of games and you can't wait for them to be released, go with the XBox360..  if you want the most powerful system with the best graphics and best performance, then you'd probably want the PS3..","The 360 is leading in sales because it's been out for over a year, but it has only sold about 3 million worldwide.  That's not a huge lead especially with a 1 year lead.  Wii is next because it has the 2nd most consoles available (around 400,000 at launch), while the PS3 is last because it had about 175,000 units available at launch.  Survey says 9 million people would be willing to pay 600 for the PS3. Best overall system would have to be the PS3.  You did say for all around entertainment.  It has Blu-ray so you can watch HD movies if you have a HD TV.  It's also a video game machine, and the heavy hitters should be coming out sometime next year.  It can also act as web browser.",I havent played anything execpt the Wii but that game system is badass! It's fun cause its like you are actually playing and not just with buttons and joystick!,"at this moment in time, dvds cant be played on wii hddvds need an add-on for 360 (maybe ps3 too i dunno) ps3 can play blu-ray disks (possible flop though)","It depends on what you want, wii is more price efficent, is E heavy, and simpler to learn the controls. So if your looking for a good family consol, or somthing any guest can play, wii is for you. The PS3 has really good stats proscessing, graphics, ect.  And comes with blue ray dvd player (which is a risk, if the HD DVD beats blue ray, you find many compatable dvds).  All of this comes with the highest price however.  The lineup seems more T heavy than the others. So if you have an older familly, or your getting it for your self, and you don't mind investing a lot more money, the PS3 is for you.  The xbox 360 has good stats close to the ps3, for a smaller price tag.  It has an advantag, being out longer, of a bigger library, which has shown to be a lot more M heavy than  the others.  So if you like gut spewing FPS's, than the Xbox 360 is for you.","Well, I've asked this question many times before .. and after a couple of months of reading reviews, messages boards and the systems tech info .. in MY opinion, 1.

It is more powerful of outputting 1080p than the ps3, will allow consumers to choose when they want to jump on the next gen video format band wagon with hd-dvd when they want to. It's very close to selling 10 million consoles and Microsoft pretty much snagged a lot of the exclusives from sony including GTA IV where the 360 is getting hours of exclusive downloadable content. The 360 has Xbox Live which is the best online service which one can download actual movies, shows, game demos, arcade classics, new arcade games, themes, gamer pictures, etc. This console has and is going to have Gears of War, Mass Effect, Bioshock, Halo 3, GTA IV, and Assassines Creed. p.s.  Japanese analysts predicted that the 360 will dominate sales until 2011, with sony coming in second and nintendo in third."
ps3,wii,"Which is better a Xbox360,PS3,or Nintendo Wii?",i really think that the PS3 is better bc of the graphics when u play it on a some sort of a high def. xbox 360 is almost as good as the ps3. the wii is i think ok.,wii,"Its a matter of when you want to buy it.  The Xbox 360 is the best purchase for high definition gaming this year, but it is unknown how it will survive after Halo 3 is out next year.  The PS3 is not worth buying this year, do not listen to the crazy people who waited in line for it; it has no games that are good enough yet to justify its $600 price tag.  The Wii is a nice option this year as well, as the new Zelda game alone should make up for its $250 price tag, but after playing the new Zelda there aren't many other good games this year.  Basically, if the world is to implode of New Years Day 2007, buy a 360 and/or a Wii; I cannot predict which console will be the best to buy next year or after.  I can't see into the future!   Be forewarned, this topic has three different groups with a very heavy bias (aka - there are fanboys), please ignore their answers; most of them have a pretty limited view on this subject.","I would say Xbox 360 is the best to buy cause if you have a hdtv the graphics are awsome and if you have speakers it's almost like your in the game! It has sooo many great games like: Gears of War, Call of Duty 2 and 3, Halo 2 (Halo 3 and Halo Wars are coming out next year), Assassians Creed is another game that is coming out next year, Madden 07, Saints Row, Dead Rising, Chrome-hounds etc..Online is the best and you can even play and charge your ipod on it!.Here's a link with more information to Xbox 360: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360 Ps: If you like more of the interactive games, there are almost 3 games so far that got a really high rating for the Wii, and if you don't like the numchucks lol, you can use a regular controller! Here's a link for more information to the Wii: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii If you don't have a dvd player the Ps3 comes with a blue ray player, that plays dvds and you can also listen to cd's! I think the 60 Gb is better cause it has more features like wireless connection (so you don't have to plug a wire into the router). Here's a link with even more information about the Ps3 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_3","Xbox 360 because it is affordable and has the best online service. The community is vast and there is always something to do. Also the Xbox 360 has a year head-start on any other console so it has more games and the game developers are more experienced with the console, knowing and understanding the limitations better so they can provide excellent games. The Wii is pretty good because it is trying to change the way video games are played. I see the Wii as the beginning of the gaming revolution and because of the Wii, maybe in 30 years or so, we will start seeing virtual reality games.","Well, it is definitely a matter of preference. I'd have to say the Nintendo Wii. Mostly because Xbox 360 and PS3 are just an improvement on sound and graphics. The Wii is a whole new ballgame, a wireless controller that is motion sensetive. When you are driving a car, like in ExciteTruck, you actually put it as a steering wheel or when playing tennis, like in WiiSports, you actually use it as you would a raquet. That's awesome!","PS3 Pro: 1. High Processing Power(good graphics) 2. Free online play 3. A few good exclusives Con: 1. $500-$600 2. Because online play is free many 3rd party games will not support online multiplayer. 3. PS3 has lost a few 1st and 3rd party publishers and developers. 4. EA has claimed that it is harder to port games to the PS3 because of the Blu-ray technology. They stated that it will take a lot longer to port Crysis to the PS3 from the PC. So some game companies may not want to go through the hastle of porting their games over to the PS3. 5. Doesn't come with HD cables 6. Blu-ray takes up 2-4 times more space on a hard drive than regular format. 7. It will need 6 months to a year to work out all its bugs 8. If there are problems with your console, its on you.(Sony has proved in the past that they will not replace or repair reject consoles without having to pay $150-$200. 9. Can only play certain PS1 and PS2 games.  Nintendo Wii Pro: 1. $250 2. Play old school games 3. Free online play 4. Innovative controller 5. A few good exclusives 6. Very small and compact 7. A bunch of controller accessories Con: 1. Not very powerful(last gen graphics) 2. Because online play if free many 3rd party games will not support online multiplayer 3. Doesn't support High Definition. 4. Extra $ for controller accessories 5. Doesn't play DVD's(that I know of) 6. Will need a year to work out it's bugs  Xbox 360: Pro: 1. Great Graphics 2. Xbox Live is better than ever 3. Super comfortable controller 4. Has gained many 1st and 3rd party publisher and developers. 5. Great games 6. Bugs have already been worked out 7. Peter Jackson(director of Lord of the Rings and King Kong) will be working exclusively with Microsoft. 8. Metal Gear Solid 4(the PS3's killer app) has been rumored to be coming to the Xbox 360.(this months issue of EGM) 9. Microsoft may be trying to by Capcom(Resident Evil, Dead Rising) 10. Great accessories 11. Can play Xbox games 12. Exclusive content for GTA IV Con: 1. $50 dollars for Live, but is totally worth it. 2. Can't play all Xbox games, but most of the good ones are playable, and more are becoming available. 3. HD-DVD player is extra, but is one of the best looking  HD-DVD players out there.(in my opinion)  The PS3 may have slightly better graphics, but the 360 is better in almost every other way. Besides most game companies don't take advantage of the power of the systems. Just like the last-gen games, no one showed the true power of the Xbox until Ubisoft unleashed Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory. The Wii is a good system and is totally worth $250, but doesn't have that many great games for anyone over the age of 13. I do suggest getting the Xbox 360 it is the superior system, and latter on when the Wii may have some games actually worth playing, buy one. I think its kind of like the difference between Plasma and LCD. Sure the Plasmas(PS3) look better(not much better), but they also don't last as long and have a better chance of getting a picture burnt in on the screen. While the LCDs(Xbox 360) are cheaper, look great, have a less chance of burn-in, and are slightly more compact. The LCD's have more bang for your buck. P.S. I'm not comparing characteristics of a TV and a game console, this is just an example.",1 Xbox 360 lots of features and lots of great games. 2 Wii  pretty awesome because of the controller but not many great games right now. 3 Ps3(blows),i have a ps2 i dont find it cool i tried out wii few days ago in a mall found it pretty cool,"Let it be known - the PS3 is quite an experience. It may be $600, but that isn't much for what you're getting. You should only get a PS3 if you are a HARDCORE gamer, meaning you live for gaming. With a 60GB harddrive, any operating system (Like Mac OS X) can be installed on it. It's internet connection is amazing. With a cable modem, the pages load on the internet browser with a blink of an eye. As for the internet service, don't be fooled, it is GREAT. XBox Live is amazing, but it is NOT free. To connect to the internet, JUST TO PLAY ONLINE GAMES, costs money, a flat rate. Check that out http://www.xbox.com/en-us/live/default.htm there. The Playstation Network Platform has many features. For one, it's free to browse and play games. Like any online service, it costs $$$ to download add-ins (like more levels) to games, or to download a game to your large 60GB hard drive. With Playstation Network Platform, you can have a video conversation with any friend from around the world, for free! Playstation one games can be downloaded from PlayStartion Network Platform, and played from the large 60GB hard drive, or downloaded to your psp for some protable fun, for a low price. When XBox Live is free, let me know. ;-). The Playstation 3's processor the Cell Broadband Engine, the mastermind of the entire system, has 8 cores, or 8 separate processors inside of it, to process multiple tasks, like heavy rain showers, with each droplet having it's own characteristics, or the spike grenades in Resistance: Fall of Man, (40 of them) all have their own dynamics. Not even the XBos 360 can do this. The processor in the XBox 360 has only 3 cores, which can leave it to process about 15 of the spikes in the grenade, with a light rainshower in the background, with no wind affecting either the spikes' movement, or the raindrops', unlike the PlayStation 3. The processor is also much fatser, due to the 8 cores. The faster you can think, the more things you can think about, and that makes you smarter. In addition to this, other, smaller, less powerful processors can be found throughout the system, and imbedded in the motherboard, which are specialized in certain aspects of a game, such as physics, shading, and coloring. With no physics, your snowflakes would drop to the ground straight down even with a 100mph gust of wind. Your snowflakes would all be identical. Without shading, darkness of the shadows would be completely dull. Without coloring, well, you know how your picture would look. Then there's the addition of the Blu-Ray disc. The Blu-Ray disc is a 1080p High Definition capable CD, that can hold 25GB of information, in the Playstation 3's case. This leads to longer games, and better looking games, with amazing physics. The XBox 360 can handle an HD-DVD disc, which, while awesome in it's own right, can hold 16GB. This disc is also 1080p high definition capable. The Playstation 3 can handle up to 7 wireless bluetooth controllers, each with motion sensing capability. They can detect the angle that the controller is in. While not comparable to the amazing 'Wii-mote' it is certaintly better than the clunky XBox 360 remote.  The XBox 360 does not have motion sensing capability, and while it does have a vibration function, the controller signals in some controllers drops when the battery gets to 20% full. The Playstation 3's controller uses an ND system, which is a power system in which the controllers capabilities do no fade away, even when there is only 1% of bettery life left. In addition, the XBox 360 store, to its credit, is now offering TV shows. I'm just sitting around waiting for them to give us a 60GB drive to store them in. My local radio station reported today, that an independent study group, claims that 300,000 XBox 360 systems have gotten free manufacturer's defect repairs. My old XBox completely failed on me, scratching all of my discs, and Microsoft wrote back saying tha",ps3,ps3 all the way,i really think that the PS3 is better bc of the graphics when u play it on a some sort of a high def. xbox 360 is almost as good as the ps3. the wii is i think ok.,"If you have a lot a friends and family,love to be entertain, and cash is your MAIN priority then get the wii because it's only 250 but if you are obssed with graphics and is some kind of spectacle nerd get the ps3 or xbox 360. But when it really comes down down to it , who really cares about the graphics unless they look preety s h i t t y, it's all about havin fun and the Wii definelty delivers when it comes to fun.","xbox 360 absolute great gaming system it has comfort and graphics it is smallwer then the PS3 and much cheaper and more availabilty it also has much better games and its xbox live is a major plus with new games such as gears of war call of dut 3 and soon halo 3 is great also unlike PS3 it gives u the choice to expand into a full media station so u dont have to pay the price in the begiing also the graphcs might be worse but it is barely noticible in gears of war the graphics are so amazing i almost thught it was real the wii is a totally different gaming device its aim isnt graphics and high tech tho the graming expericine is also great and affordable unlike the other 2 it has creativity and flipping awsome name! the PS3 is just burnt by the other too it is too expensive and has so many bad sides it is just nto worth it also more points are 1. Most of the 360's problems have been fixed. It's been over a year, which means most problems that occur have been reported, and MS has fixed it. So, if you buy a 360, don't expect to have a lot of problems. 2. This time around, the 360 is getting more games than the XBX because of more 3rd party support, and it's been out for over a year, so many 3rd parties have had plenty of time to get to know the 360 architecture. 3. MS is easier to program for than the PS3, so 3rd party that don't have a talented staff might make games for the 360 instead of the PS3. 4. MS can't make a dent in the Japanese market, so Japanese developers may not develop games for the 360, so a lot of the games that you know may not appear on the 360. 5. DVD-9 might not be enough space for developers, so they may stay around from the 360. Games are getting bigger and bigger, more and more realistic, so it's going to require a lot of space. Blue Dragon is rumored to take up 3 DVD-9. That would fit in one Blu-ray. Less profit if it takes up more than 1 disk since the price is still 59.99. 6. XBL is still the premiere online service. 7. PS3 will have plenty of issues because it's the launch, and most launch consoles have problems. As the problems get reported, Sony will fix it, and the next wave of PS3 should have less problems than the launch wave. 8. It's still debatable over which console will have the most games. Most 3rd party games will appear on both consoles, so it's going to be up to the 1st and 2nd parties to make the difference. 9. Some of the bigger franchises are still picking PS3 for it's time exclusivity. It is rumored that Rockstar (Grand Theft Auto 4) and Ubisoft (Assassin's Creed) offered Sony a chance to lock them up for the first 6 months, but Sony was slow to act, so now those franchises are appearing on both systems at the same time. 10. PS3's online is free, but it's probably not going to be anywhere near as good as XBL. Don't listen to the guy above about PS3 not working on regular TV. PS3 will work on regular TV. I should know. I had to use the composite cable that came with the PS3 in order to set up the PS3 for my HD TV. I also played Resistance using the composite cables, and it works fine. the wii i resently found out is also probably going to be amazing it is backwards compatible with gamecube controllers also its technology for controlers are amazing and probably the most important factor the game coming out for the wii are by far better"
ps3,wii,What would be better to get...the ps3 or the Wii?,The PS3,people will kill you over the PS3 so go for the Wii this time.,The PS3,"are u retard?  the wii is a toy, while the PS3 is a freaking entertainment center for ur home. it kills the wii on anything. just think of what games are going to come out for the PS3 in the next 12 months and then do the same for the wii",Simple Answer: ppppp ssssss 3333333 p      p s                      3 ppppp ssssss     33333 p                   s            3 p         ssssss 3333333        TRUST ME ITS MUCH< MUCH BETTER THAN THE WII EXCEPT THE WII HAS THOSE NEW CONTROLS.,"I suggest PS3, because PS3 can just download games from the internet, very convenient.

ps3,wii,What next-gen console has the best games: Wii or PS3?,In my opinion Wii has the best games. I am a huge fan of Zelda and Mario. You can't get either game for any other console but Nintendo. Those 2 games are the only reason I bought a Gamecube. And those 2 games will be the only reason I buy a Wii.,i think the wii because you can play your game cube games on it and for the ps3 you have to buy the game for it,In my opinion Wii has the best games. I am a huge fan of Zelda and Mario. You can't get either game for any other console but Nintendo. Those 2 games are the only reason I bought a Gamecube. And those 2 games will be the only reason I buy a Wii.,the Wii b.c its cheeper AND you dont need no gay ass bluray,Wii is the better deal of those two but 360 is the best of all the next-gen consoles.,"It is totally up to you. The Nintendo Wii has a built in motion censor, so you can mimic te movement you would make in real life. With the PS3 the graphics are outstanding. The controllers are also wireless. The prices are: Nintendo Wii:$250.00, and the PS3 is $600.00. If you asked me the best bet is a Nintendo Wii. Good luck with your choice though.",PS3 all the way. way better graphics too. but its pricy.,"well right now RESISTANCE is the sh!t. it's awesome. but imagine when MGS4 comes out?. how about devil may cry 4? grand turismo hd? killzone 2? half life 2? grand theft auto 4? god of war 3? assasins creed? final fantasy 7? burnout 5? fight night: round 3? unreal tournament 7? soccom 4? resident evil 5? tekken 5? virtua fighter 5? heavenly sword? LIAR?, etc, etc, etc. this are the reasons why the PS3 is going to beat the other consoles, especially the wii. wii=weak now imagine any of those games on a nintendo wii? IMPOSIBLE!!!, because the wii doesn't have the power to do so.","Wii. PS3 has but one good game( im talking system exclusives, not something u can get on another system) and that is Resistance:Fall of Man. Other than that, PS3 launch lineup sucks.

And I would still have to go with the 360. It has the best graphics and is the most powerful, to top it off you can download movies and TV. I love my 360 but the fact of the matter is that Sony is at war with HD DVD. All is hindering on its sucsess. If blu ray looses then the PS3 will fail and sony will be hurting badly, however if HD DVD looses then xbox 360 will never get to true high def TV. In the end I think you should get a wii a true gaming system","The PS3 is the best, but it is expensive, and, in my opinion, it's only worth geting if you have an HDTV.  The Wii is the cheepest and it has that cool controler.  I don't see to many good things for the Xbox 360 other than Halo 3.","Each system has it's good things and it's bad things.....The PS3 has the best graphics,hands down, the other system don't come close. Also, you can play all of your PS2 games on here...that gives you a universe of games.  BUT the PS3 is super expensive and the grapics will not be as good if you don't have a HDTV.  360 is pretty good, a decent price, good graphics and ok games, but nothing really spectacular here.  Wii, is something new and really cool, not too expensive either, but it needs SOO much better games to compare to PS3 and 360.--------So, go for the PS3 for the best, go for the Wii for the cheapest, and the 360 for good quality."

XBOX 360 was rushed to market a year ago. It has major system flaws. PS3 coming out just now is the newest, and most tested system.

PS3 handles more multimedia, more frequent software updates & features, and a MASSIVE backwards compatable list.

Then we get into the built in blu-ray, built in wifi, and the HDMI out.

360 is bubbly like childrens jumbo legos and the ps3 is sleek liek a highly customized linux build.","ps2 is way better than xbox and gamecube imagine how good ps3 is gonna be ps3 is using blue-ray which is 5 times bigger than dvd so that means 5 times better grafix than before, 2 times better than xbox 360 and wifii sony and like 10 other research companies have spent like 5 years on an extreme and special microprocessor that will have 8 other procesors in it so its 40x faster than the ps2 u can also use psp as a remote control and transfer music, videos, and pics to ps3 ps3 can also have a 20 or 60 gigabyte hard drive that you can remove wich is hecka tight its supported by more than 170 of the world’s leading consumer electronics like dell, apple, HP, Panasonic, samsung, and sony--of course ps3 is already out ($500 or $600 retail price) you can buy the ps3 pro for $250 at ebay the ps3 is so good that people were going crazy for it wich never happened before---ever ps3 is da bomb no doubt","PS3 because it has Blue ray,sixaxis controlllers, and next generation graphics","ps3 takes the cake. Why? -Bluetooth technology (you can transfer photos and videos from your bluetooth phone, connect your bluetooth headset that you use for your phone to your ps3 for online chat, etc.) -Built-in WIFI connect to the internet wirelessly and for free by using somebody else's connection within a 1000 foot range. -Large Blu-Ray Disc capacity allows game developers to put more Data into the disc for better games. Web Browser- the Xbox 360 DOESN'T have this as well, a built in web browser in the PS3 Cross Media Bar (lets you surf online with the ps3 remote or a bluetooth keyboard as well a USB keyboard. you can be on this very website wirelessly and for free with your PS3 on a BIG Screen TV. Not to mention Sony is currently losing a little over $300 for each system they are making (hoping to make their money back with long-term video game profits) That just shows how much more technology is put into each one of these Units.  These are just some of the facts of why PS3 blows the other 2 systems away.","If you have a broadband internet connection, then the 360 should be at the top of your list.  You get a crazy amount of demos, hd videos, multiplayer gaming, patches, and it's all done extremely well for $60 a year.  I'm sure sony will have a comparable service, but I don't know if it will be as reliable.  Xbox live is proven. If you are very concerned with HD movie playback right out of the box, then obviously the PS3 is the choice.  I'm sure Blu-Ray is awesome and I'd love to have it.  But you do need a nice HDTV to enjoy that. I wouldn't bother with the wii, personally. So basically, if you have broadband, it's the 360 no question.  If you have a huge 1080p hdtv, then it's the PS3 no question.  If you have neither of those, then it's the 360 for the larger library of games at the moment.",The Wii is the best.

ps3,wii,"Sorry, must ask.  Which one: 360, Wii, or PS3?","Wii, hands down.

          The PS3 has the best tech. specs. overall, but at $600?  The blu-ray format will hold a lot more data than the current gen or any of the next gen, and hints at future innovation in the amount of data put into games.  It most definitely ""beats its uncle,"" but at this time the PS3 seems full of unnesecary frills that dont' do alot but raise the price tag.

          The XBox 360 is anything but ancient.  With graphics that will compete (though they are weaker) with the PS3 and an already impressive game line-up and an HD enhancement on the way, not to mention XBox Live, which is the best online support for a system thus far, the 360 is a strong, yet far underrated competitor.  The price, though high, is still less than the PS3, and with most of the hardware glitches worked out by now, it will be a much sturdier bet for the price.

          And now to the wii.  The line-up at launch is to say the least incredible.  There are games such as red steel and Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess for hard-core gamers,the ""kiddie games"" for the lil' tykes, and other titles that meet in the middle.  With full motion sensitivity, the wii is a true innovation to gaming.  The design is compact (about the size of three DVD cases stacked atop one another) and it will fit in tight spaces thanks to the slot loading device.  Though it is somewhat prone to breaking the wii is reinforced with steel plating on the inside(thus it is three DVD cases, not two).  Now we come to the all-important price tag.  At $250 the wii is by far the cheapest system, and with a game included, is the only system that is bundled with one.  Once you spend alot of money on the console, how much are you going to want to spend on games?  Unlike the other systems, Nintendo has guarnteed that all first party(games produced by Nintendo) will not cost more then $50 before taxes, though second and third party titles are at the discretion of the producing company.  

          Seeing all this, you might be able to make your decision more easily.  Though the 360 and PS3 have more power, the wii will be cheaper now and later, and will is more innovative.  It is a breath of fresh air that the stagnant gaming industry needs.","Wii, hands down.           The PS3 has the best tech. specs. overall, but at $600?

Therefore, I choose the Wii.","All three of the systems have their strong and weak points, but I think the Wii is the best overall.  Of course the rarphics don't campare to the xbox 360 or the PS3 with it's blue-ray DVD player, but they are getting better and with a price tag of $250, it is a lot cheaper than the other two.  Also, with its innovative new controller with motion sensors is just plain awesome! Many of the games are great and I'm especially looking forward to the new Zelda game.  Many people refer to Nintendo games as kiddie games, but why is that such a bad thing? Many of the games are great anyways.  The Wii will also have online capability and downloadable games of past Nintendo games. The PS3 is nice, but many won't want to dig that deep into their pockets and pay the price tag of $600. It really has some sweet graphics but with only 400,000(maybe even less) available at launch, and many Sony fans out there, it's pretty unlikely you'll get one this year.  Nintendo has 1 million ready so there's more of a chance to get the Wii.  The PS3 also has problems already since they recently found out that it doens't support some of the older Playstation games. Overall, if you're willing to pay for the PS3 it will be worth it.  The 360 had a nice quality but not many of the games interest me.  The Wii really thought of everything with the new controller, downloadable classics, a sleek design, and great launch titles.  This is juct my opinion, but I think the Wii is by far the best",i love the wii  you can find out what people think at my site www.funzone98.piczo.com and got the funtalk page and post your comments on  ps3 xbox 360 and nintendo wii and read what other people think,"according to what you said, don't buy the xbox 360, one game isn't everything Wii has good gameplay PS3 has good multimedia I'd go with gameplay, that's why it's called a videoGAME and the Wii is cheapest","The Xbox 360 is anything but ancient, its the best of the three systems.  Xbox Live is better than ever, great games, awesome graphics, comfortable controller, and most of the bugs have been worked out. The PS3 isn't worth $300 much less $600, at E3 the system had tons of problems, including that the controller didn't live up to the hype and the system would overheat in less than 4 hours.  It had many problems and I doubt if all the bugs were worked out in 6 months.  Plus when the 360 had its overheating problems(for consoles made only in 2005) Bill Gates paid for the repairs out of his own pocket, when Sony had problems with the PS2, Sony said pay up or get another console.  And the Wii is worth $350, so the $250 price tag is a steal. Gears of War VS. Resistance VS. Red Steel=Xbox 360 $400 VS. $600 VS. $250=$250(Nintendo Wii) HD-DVD VS. Blu-Ray VS. None=HD DVD(Xbox 360) Processing Power=PS3 Accessories=Xbox 360 Halo 3 VS. Killzone 2 VS. Zelda: TP=Halo 3(Xbox 360) Controller=Nintendo Wii Xbox Live VS. PS3 Online VS. Wii Online=Unknown Xbox 360=4 PS3=1                                     Nintendo Wii=2 Winner: Xbox 360 Runner Up: Nintendo Wii In my opinion the only 2 consoles worth picking up are the Xbox 360 and the Nintendo Wii.  The Wii is all about the controller and old school games.  And the 360 has power and great games and online play on it's side.","Dont get the 360, that things sucks. Its very expensive, The Playstation 3 my couisin just got he put it down on the table followed all the instructions to put it togther and it never worked. I just bought a Wii yesterday and it is excellent and for its low price of 250 (In America) But its great. I reccommend it if you are going to  get one. Good Luck!","ps3- Many people are saying that this is the best console that there is going to be... Me I say not. The ps2 did not have many good games that were only for the ps2, and many of the ports were better for the other two systems. Unless you are a high-definition freak with $600 to throw away than it serves no purpose to you. Only reason for the high price is their stupid blue-Ray dvd drives, I don't know about anybody else but if I buy a game system, I'm going to use it to play games, not dvds. X360- The older of the next gen. Would have been a better marketing strategy for them to release halo 3 around the same time as the release of the Wii and ps3, but anyway... This is the better system if you are a high def freak, that actually likes good games even if the graphics are a tad worse than the ps3. Possibly better online system, but this has not been proven yet. Wii- My favorite of the three, mainly because I'm biased because I've been a Nintendo fan for a while. Revolutionary game play with the new WiiMote. Although from what I read its not as good as PC with FPS, it still looks great. For the not so high def freak, that prefers standard Nintendo quality video games such as Zelda, Mario, and SSBB.","You moron, hopefully your husband didn't tell you that or else your husband is completely retarded. The xbox games ARE compatabile with the 360 you just need the harddrive(and xbl account for the update) smarty pants. If you were a gamer you would know that. There are certain games that aren't, but microsoft is expanding the list at all times. And with this melting this, that's such bullshit. You can buy an intercooler from gamestop, it happens to computers as well. If Microsoft would have just put in more fans in the system there would be no problem, and I bet Sony will have the same problem. The 360 has good game selection there's going to be halo 3, halo wars, there's gears of war, cod3, vegas, etc. No one can ever look aside of halo. I will always stick with the 360 just because the game selection fits to me and then the wii because it's fun. But the ps3 just doesn't appeal to me, gta already went to the 360 so that covers me. That's the only thing I liked on it. It's too overpriced for no reason other than a shitty dvd player in it and everyone's getting ripped off on it. Then Nintendo's coming in and also ripping you off for $250 since the other prices are up so much just because they can. Yep.","360 last, later wii, first ps3.","My husband and Son (the son is 16) say that the PS3 will outshine the 360 AND Wii. My husband thinks the XBOX was a piece of garbage, from the get-go. They, both, are gamers and my husband is in the Computer Industry. (NOT gaming end, tech end) They both agree that the PS2 graphics are higher quality and that the PS3 will, most likely, be as good........probably better. The only draw-back, to the PS3 will be cost. Also, the XBOX games are NOT compatible with the 360. This means that you spent upwards of $60, per game, for games you now find are useless. The PS2 games will be compatible with the PS3, thus making the $60+ for the games worth the cost of the new unit. Their favorite games are 'Halo','Samurai Warriors' and 'Silent Hill'.","Wii for sure. Xbox 360 is laughable... it still overheats unless you have it sitting in the fridge. Plus the game selection is meh.  PS3 is way overpriced. Sony may have shot themselves in the foot... plus it's going to be hard to get one anyway due to under-manufacturing, and on top of that, Sony has rushed it out in order to be able to get the most out of Black Friday (busiest shopping day of the year), so I expect issues and bugs. However, Playstation has always had phenomenal support in terms of games.  Wii is classic Nintendo goodness. Decently priced, and it's launching with ass-kicking games (Zelda & Red Steel for example). Great new controller that everyone is curious about, and did I mention Zelda? Oh and yeah, and Zelda is a launch game! Zelda is good. Zelda is great. I want my Wii!","I believe I answered a question very similar to this yesterday.  I am going to sum it up by telling you the ps3.  The nintendo yes...way too many kiddy games.  XBox360..i own one..but will still be buying a ps3.  I want the ps3 more than i ever wanted the xbox360..yes i love the halo.  But when you have games like grandtheftauto metal gear solid need for speed.  Also..rainbox6:vegas is also coming out for ps3.  The fact that ps3 has bluray is a hugeee deal.  ITs hd-dvd.  It is, will be, and will continue to be the cheapest blu-ray player for quite some time. The ps3 will destroy ps2..you can play all games from ps1, ps2 on the ps3.  I heard you can even play psp games on it.  To sum it up..ps3 hands down. C'mon people. Be serious.","PS3 all the way!! Im going to wait in line for this buy. I think this should be a hot seller due to the long 4 year wait, but also the new rendering bodies and tons of new featured games. The Nintendo i believe is going to be reaching a much younger crowd with games and graphics. Either way both systems are going to be new and improved from other systems on the market. The PS3 should he a hot seller. The size of the hardware is due to size increase in everything, fans, memory, processors. I think it should kick the ps2 to the curb. check out gamespot and goto ps3 videos. You will be blown away with the rendering capabilities. Way too cool.","U are retarded. PS3 is cheaper than it should be it has  BLU-RAY player, which are going alone for no less than 800$.Now i will point out why u are a frickin moron retard crap eater for saying the other stupid comments u made. Wii? Kiddie? Now i like every zombie killin, blood squirting gore fest just as much as the next guy, but if games like Mario and Pikmin Animal crossing game because they are quote 'cutesie', or 'childish', than u are missing out. U wouldnt be gaming right now had the NES and Mario not single-handedly saved the gaming industry. Now for the 360. First off, if u are not a total idiot ( like I know u are) and leave the 360 on for 16 hours straight, it will not blow up. Now i will list 10 awesome 360 games.Gears of War, Elder Scrolls, Ghost Recon, Lost planet, Mass Effect,Dead rising, Call of Duty 2, Call of Duty 3, Blue Dragon, and Halo 3. thank u for ur time"

ps3,wii,"What is the best gaming system ever PS3, XBOX360, or NINTENDO WII?","The best of anything is a matter of opinion, so here's mine:

The Wii is designed for a different kind of gamer than the X-Box 360 and the PS3.  As someone who works in electronics, and as a gamer, I see them in two different categories.  When I first approached the question of which was the best, I decided to first compare the 360 to the PS3.

- When you break down the numbers, Xbox 360 has probably more performance than PS3. But both systems pack a lot of power for high definition games and entertainment.

- The Xbox 360 is a clear winner for graphics. The GPU is more powerful. It has more powerful fillrate, and far more pixel and vertex processing horsepower. The 360 also has a clever new way rendering high definition anti aliased back buffers.

- Because the X-Box 360 was released a full year before the PS3, almost all multi-platform developers have made the 360 their primary platform due to timing of release-to-market, this means the games will look and perform better on the 360. The PS3 versions will be ports of the 360 versions. The 360 is also far faster to develop for due to better development tools, better documentation, and easier architecture (3 general purpose CPU’s vs. 8 specialized processors that require DMA).

- The Xbox 360 offers HD-DVD as an add-on for $150. The PS3 comes with one built in (Blu-Ray). The X-Box 360 wins because the DVD player is a separate unit. Playing movies is very taxing on the DVD reader. In a few years, when your PS3 DVD drive goes out due to playing lots of movies (PS2 was notoriously bad about this), you will have to go buy another PS3. With the X-Box 306, you'll just need to replace your HD-DVD player.

After concluding that the 360 is a clear winner over the PS3 (over-priced, over-hyped and under-produced), it was time to decide between it and the Wii.  I'm a big Nintendo fan, being that the Nintendo was my first console ever.  I loved the Mario Bros, and have fond childhood memories of that and Duck Hunt. :)  I also really like the interactive aspect of the Wii, the ability to download and play games from all the previous consoles, and the fact that it only costs $249.  If I wanted a HD DVD player, I'd buy one.  But I was in the market for a gaming console.  So I choose the Wii.

I love the Wii.  I have NFS Carbon and Madden for it.  Both are so awesome.  The playability is rediculous.  The only cons that I have to list:
- I had a sore shoulder for a couple days from trying to hit homeruns after playing Tennis for a couple hours on the Wii-Sports that came with the system.
- Twice I've noticed I was sucking at Carbon only to realize it was almost 4am.  Oops.

It's actually more affordable, easier to get your hands on, and has alot of awesome games like Zelda: Twilight Princess. I also think the new controller will make games more life-like.  The Xbox has been out for a while so easy to find with great games, but the Wii has more good points.  The PS3 only has one thing to show off which is the blue-ray but it is way overrated and doesn't live up to the hype.  It's also overpriced and hard to find.  And they're commercials suck...",wii60 (you can get a wii and a 360 for < a ps3),"It is all preference, and the amount of money you have. I want all 3.

ps3,wii,What should I GET??? The Wii or the PS3???,THE WII. It is more innovative and it costs a lot less.,"I would get the Nintendo Wii, then.  Every review i'm reading so far is saing that the Wii is more fun, and with the Wiimote, much more immersive than the PS3. Not only that, but you can almost buy three Wii's for the price of one PS3. I'm pretty happy with my Xbox360, and i'll probably be picking up a Wii in a few months or so.  The PS3 is just way too expensive.",I have this really good comercial that will help you!! http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-9136575504838642038&hl=en,books suk,be like me and get a ps3 next year when its cheaper.  metal gear!!!!!,Get a book,well... the wii has worse graphics and its the first console with a remote in stead of controllers so it might suck a little the ps3 have better graphics but the system and game cost a lot,THE WII. It is more innovative and it costs a lot less.
ps3,wii,"What's better:ps3,xbox360 or nintendo wii?","I think the Wii is better. I mean, the controllers are awesome. It's like however you move or swing the controller, your guy does in game. And, it has some good looking games coming out for it soon, like Super Smash Bros. Brawl and Mario Galaxy. It also has features that lets you download old N64, gamecube, Super nintendo and all other nintendo stations online to the Wii. Overall, the Wii is awesome.",I'm looking forward to the Wii. No reason other than I enjoy childish nintendo games.,Why does this question pop up everyday?  There's really no answer for this!  Every single person is going to have a different opinion on what is the best.  The system that is the best is the one that you like.  It's that simple.

I can assure you the wii will be a fizzle in the fireworks. It will skyrocket and die quickly everything made by nintendo these days are for the kids.,"X-box 360, i have one, i like it b/c u can play old games on it after u download the software 4 it, the only reason i would consider buying the wii is the control scheme, like in the Zelda game coming out 4 it u can use the Wiimote like a sword and wut u do with the wiimote Link does on the screen","I like Wii, but it depends greatly on what your opinion is. Check the strenghts and weaknesses of each console.","That question is impossible to answer, since the PS3 and Wii aren't even released to the marketplace yet.  Once they are released, it will take time to really see which is 'better' (a very subjective thing anyway) because the only way to judge is by the games that are available.  The highest quality, fastest, most advanced gaming console would be worthless if there weren't a good number of high-quality, high-profile games for it.",i think the wii because u can actually play boxing with actually punching at the air and u can golf and stuff like that.  that stuff is in wii sports and that comes with the wii and it looks really fun.  unlike the xbox 360 and the ps3 its like ur actually in the game. it cost a lot less than the ps3 also.,"Wii, because sony hasnt been around as long as NINTENDO!!","Depends what you want. The Wii is a whole new type of thing and if you want something like that clearly it is the best. I think the 360 is teh best, but so far the PS3 doesn't have any exclusives I really want and I'm not that concerned about a Blu-Ray. Besides a 360 is upgradeable, although not sure how easy as I haven't upgraded mine and not many hardware upgrades, and the PS3 ISN'T.","I get an email newsletter from one of the 'puter mags and the guy who reviewed wii said it was very engaging (he couldn't stop playing with it all weekend!) ... also, it's 1/2 the price of the xbox (but U can't play DVD's). ps3 didn't get as good reviews, and with the new xbox you can't play some of the old games on it. So I guess it's your choice depending on your gaming needs."
ps3,wii,Which Rules PS3 or Wii?,definatly PS3! No doubt about it...and all u people out there who think it costs 2 much...do u think people really care! hell no! I want one of those so bad and would do anything to get it...but give me a Wii and I will throw a hissy fit!,I guess it depends on what games your into....and how old you are.....I would say that without a doubt the PS3 is better but the Nintendo Wii will more than likely be great for young kids...since Nintendo seems to specialize in kid games....,definatly PS3!

It's just that Nintendo has produced many games that anyone can play that it is percieved as a 'kiddie console' but The Wii has its share of adult oriented games too. It's just a question of Same-old-but-better-graphics vs. Innovative-but-lesser-graphics.","I have to say Wii and only because I'm not much of a gamer.  PS3 is for the hard core gamer who is into heavy graphics, etc.  Wii is for us old school video game players...remember Pac Man and Galaga?  LOL","For the majority of people, the answer will be the PS3. Like the other guy said, the Wii is more family oriented and, of course, for us Old Schoolers. The only thing I really worry about is that they won't be releasing any old third-party games, that would be tragic. However, I resent the implication that the Wii is a kids system. I'm a older than most of the people clamoring for a PS3, and with that age comes the maturity that doesn't care one way or another about how bloody a game is and weights design and story above graphics and 'adult' themes. The best games ever had graphics people would laugh at today and were perfectly appropriate for any age.","well...lets c..ps3 i would love to have, would all the da games titles...i need to play...but wii, nexgen playin...they might not have a lot of title but the gameplay makes u interact with ur games...instead of lookin stupid with ur controller on the ps3, tryin to make that tight corner turn...u actually have a reason to do it with the wii...so either way, i'm buyin both...that is the only way to find out...graphix/titles or interactive gameplay...i will let u know...laters:p"
ps3,wii,"What is the best console for a 12 year old. PS3 or Wii, not thinking about cost?","Definitely Wii, for multiple reasons.

Wii has some really solid game choices; whether the 12-year-old prefers adventure games such as Mario or Zelda, action games like Call of Duty 3, Red Steel, or Splinter Cell, sports games like Madden '07, or racing games like Excite Truck - there is a nice variety whereas PlayStation consoles tend to lean towards more mature or hardcore gamers. Plus, Nintendo has developers' support and a strong strategy which ensures that a steady stream of games will be released for a long time to come.

After playing both the PS3 and Wii hands-on, I can say that the Wii is more enjoyable. Its unique motion-sensing controller truly enhances the gameplay experience; it's really fun to swing the controller like a baseball bat, swoosh it through the air like a football pass, or slash it like a sword compared to just pressing buttons.

ps3,wii,who do u thing is better ps3 or wii ?????,"absolutely wii. ps3 may have superior graphic but size doesn't matter. wii will have more interactive games and that makes wii win. nintendo ds has proved it, they already beat psp despite  psp's better hardware and graphics.","absolutely wii. ps3 may have superior graphic but size doesn't matter. wii will have more interactive games and that makes wii win. nintendo ds has proved it, they already beat psp despite  psp's better hardware and graphics.","The PS3 has incredible graphics(something like 3 times that of the x box 360's) and mature titles and is like a standard gaming console, while the Wii has a simple controller that has three accelerometers that enable you to move the controller sideways to turn a steering wheel or aim and fire a gun. It has fewer mature titles because it is made by Nintendo.",I wasn't able to get a PS3 but now I'm glad I didn't. The Nitendo WII is the most inovative game system I've ever seen. The controllers are totally cool and make the gaming experience very comfortable. Nintendo really hit the jackpot with this one. I was able to get online imediately with my wireless network and look forward to cruising the internet in the future. Save your money and buy a WII.,"Well this is kind of a hard one. If you like a game for the pretty graphics and buckets of blood, then get the PS3. But if your like me and enjoy a game because it is fun just to play, and not over the top with blood then get the Wii. So it really depends on you type of games you like. In my opinion all systems are the same except the controllers. Before anybody says anything, I dont care which system you like as far as I am concerned they are all very good but at different things. Even a year after launch the 360 still has no games I would play and I found one game for the PS3 that looks good and it dosent even come out until late next year. WHAT IS WITH THE BLUE-RAY!!! My tv isnt HD so its not even worth for me to buy a PS3 or even a 360. So I will be buying a Wii. There is already 3 launch tiltles I wish to play Zelda, Excite Truck, and well Wii Sports. Not to mention it might actually be fun to play madden."
ps3,wii,Should I get the Wii or the PS3? I like em both.?,"PS3, it can do everything the Wii can do and more.  It even has motion sensors, like the Wii  (it is the main controls for the game Warhwk)  Theres also Blu-ray disc drive, which normally costs $1,000, thats y it costs so much.  With memory stick slots on the PS3 makes it easier to transfer videos music & photos onto its 20GB or 60GB hard drive. It also can play PS2 and PS One games, and dvds.  The wii cant even play dvds!  It has you can also go on the internet and it even has its own instant messeging program, and the wii doesn't.  If you have a PSP your able to hook that up to the PS3 and tranfer files from your PSP to the PS3.  You will also be able to use it in more many different things in games (like as the controller and rear view mirror in Formula 1).  Plus theres games like Resistance Fall of Man, Madden, and Warhawk (which uses the motion sensors).  If there are and glitches or problems i'm sure you will be able to fix them with the system updates, just like the PSP has.   It may cost more but that's only cuz you are gettin more and at a better quality.",the wii has motion sensor and the ps3 doesnt i dont know what u like the wii is inovative  the ps3 has wifi and costs a bunch more it has blu ray which may be good only if blu ray takes off and comes down in price the games for the wii might be more childly but they are showing an effort to get more mature games on the way,"I'd go for the Wii. It's more affordable than the PS3. Plus it would be a whole new gaming experience using the new motion sensative controller, and you can surf the net (wirelessly), put your digital photos on the system, chat with other people, watch DVD's, and save your stuff on the internal memory. The Wii is also has Gamecube backward compatability so if you or your friends have a gamecube, you can play with the Wii. PS3 is going to be around $350, but Wii is just $250 and it already comes with a game. Shooting games such as Call of Duty or Ghost Recon would be great when using the controller, and fighting with swords would be more interactive than pushing the X button. Go with what you want, but I'd definately get the Wii.","I'm asking myself the same thing. I'm leaning Wii only because its such a change from the usual console gaming experience. I've been playing games on my Pc since i got rid of my xbox, and have been fine with that. PS3 i have a bad feeling about, and don't get me wrong I loved Playstation games, but in the early hands on reviewers were concerned too. I guess the better question for me at  least is which is actually going to be able to be purchased, PS3 will probably not be around for months after its released.",get ps3 it has wii on it (wireless internet) wii has no internet connection has no dvd but ps3 has,"the wii is most likley for children so if u are young, get the wii..but i would suggest ps3","PS3, it can do everything the Wii can do and more.

Even though u might read the info about it, you'll get used to it in about , let's see 2 or 3 MONTHS!",OMG dude get da Wii! its awsome! i mean it looks awsome......there is a wand thingy and when you move it around and your character gets moved!,"If your looking for great graphics, a huge price tag, free online, you get the PS3. If you like something totally different in gameplay and new ideas, go for the wii. = ] Nintendo Wii coming in 1 week. =] Ps3 coming in 5 days. I prefer the Wii","I'd get a Wii for now and a PS3 two years later. Wii has alot of those fun classic franchises with the innovative control scheme but the thing it lacks is hardcore games(red steel is a good start though). 2 years down the line, the PS3 will be common and hopefully just as popular as it is now. With games like tekken the PS3 is still a good system. I'm getting a Wii on launch and a PS3 later, same thing i did for gamecube. Also the wii won't end up like gamecube because to be honest the GCN had nothing that set it apart from its competitors except for mario. The PS2 had more games, online play, and some of its own successful franchises while the only thing GCN had over the PS2 was mario and zelda. This November, i'll be getting a Wii because this system will be great.","I would probably say the Wii cuz its, like, part Wii, part GameCube. you'd have more games for it.  For the games, i suggest Super Smash Bros. Brawl for Wii and Dave Mirra:Freestyle BMX 2 for Gamecube.  Just wait till December cuz they might update it.  Besides, the PS3 is like $600"
ps3,wii,which do you prefer? wii or ps3?,"Wii, cheaper, cooler and graphics are good.  What I like about the Wii is the fact that it makes you have to phycially react to the game such as in Red Steel were you can have sword fights, gun fights and stuff.  Also in Zelda were you use the controler as a bow to make link fire.","yes, well the ps3 and the wii have their pro's and con's. PS3 Pro's: the ps3 has the HD-DVD player, (also known as 'blu-ray') has very good graphics, free internet, and pretty cool game titles. Con's: the thing is, the controller for it is the same old, same old and my eyes were getting sore looking at it all the time, plus the controller has the movement feature which is affected by the rumble feature. The price is also very high so yeah. WII Pro's: As you know already, the Wiimote has the pointing, movement, rumble, speaker features on it but unlike the ps3 controller, the rumble doesnt affect its movements. Yes, this console is pointed to the whole 'family' and will probebly be making more money. Con's: To get all the Wii Channels to work, you need Nintendo Wi-Fi connection installed at your house in the router and everything, but when you have done this, you still need Wii points to buy anything from them. in conclusion, i would pick the wii over the ps3 partly because of price, and availablity. go WII!",I like the ps3 more.It has way better graphics.pc,i would pick the wii because the ps3 might blow up like the xbox360. and i have a ds and it rocks,"I’ll have to go with the Wii system; Nintendo has always made very sturdy, reliable, and fun systems. Sony systems (particularly the PSP) have been known to break if dropped 2 feet onto carpet. Nintendo wins my vote because they are marketing their products to a wide range of ages and interests. Sony tends to market primarily to teens (and wannabe teens) who only like the first person blood-and-guts games. Sony systems also have been known to have bugs in the system at the initial release; Nintendo’s never done that. Further more, Nintendo’s wisely chosen to have made many more Wii systems than Sony has chosen to make PS3 systems; this will cause minimal to no fights and chaos when the Wii comes out unlike what’s all over the news as the PS3’s release. There’s also the price to take into consideration; The Wii costs much less than the PS3. Also, the controllers for the PS3 appear to be the same as the other Play Station games. The new “Wiimote” looks really neat, sharp, and innovative as well as lots of fun to play with.",NO1,"Wii, cheaper, cooler and graphics are good.  What I like about the Wii is the fact that it makes you have to phycially react to the game such as in Red Steel were you can have sword fights, gun fights and stuff.

They are far superior to console games.",i say wii but 2 out of 3 of my bros want the ps3.my 3rd bro wants both,wii,"Personally, I think the wii will win the next generation battle, because it's aiming for a wider audience, but if I had to choose between the two I would go for the PS3, just because it has a blu-ray player in it, and I don't want to go and spend $1000 on a blu-ray player, the games are just a added bonus. Some of the games I think most people are looking forward to seeing on the PS3 are Motorstorm(a mud racing game, where you race dirt bikes and monster trucks) and Killzone, which we all know from E3 as the game with crazy visuals. The Wii on the other hand is more of a family console which I think will draw in a much broader audience, be it it's party games like Wario Ware and Super Monkey Ball or games like Zelda, the Wii has a wider appeal to it. In conclusion, I think Wii will be the victor of the next-gen wars, but PS3 will win over the hardcore gamer, with it's superior games, graphics, and blu-ray player.",Wii is way better. It is cheaper and a better sytem and definetly more fun. Please people dont waste your money on a PS3 and get a Wii or Xbox 360.  My choice is definetly Wii.
ps3,wii,"Which system will sell more this Christmas Xbox360, PS3, or the Wii?","I doubt the PS3 will sell more than the Wii or Xbox 360.  Sure, adults will buy it for themselves, but the millions of teens don't all have parents willing to spend $600 on yet another game console.  And even teens with jobs aren't willing to shell out that much for a console, especially when the 360 and PS3 are releasing a lot of the same titles.  Besides, I heard that due to manufacturing, the next shipment of PS3 consoles isn't due for a while.  I'm not sure  about that, not that I reallyc are.

As for between the Wii and 360, well the 360 has already been out longer so it's already sold much much more than the Wii or PS3.  But if we're just looking at Christmas sales, it's really hard to tell.  And don't forget that the Wii also comes with the classic controller, which is a normal controller (a mix of the SNES controller and the N64 controller is what it looks like to me).  The interactiveness of the Wii is very attractive to a lot of buyers.  A lot of people I know are getting one or want one really badly.  I would personally guess that since the 360 has been out for quite some time, most people who want the 360 already have it, thus the Wii will sell the most.  Oh and with that last point, I realize that my first point may be invalid.  Since the 360 has been out for a while, then the PS3 may sell more during Christmas than the 360, if the whole shipment deal isn't true.","Hell no, in terms of SELLING The Wii, why? Well why not? The Xbox360 is already been sold last Christmas, BY A LOT OF PEOPLE. People that are dying for the PS3 to sell it and those who are dying to play it, cant get it due to the manufacturing problems of Sony. While not many people are going to buy Wii to SELL IT but to play it, and Nintendo has no manufacturing problems.. 360 has the next gen. gaming, however so does the PS3, either way people already have the Xbox.. Take a look  http://www.nexgenwars.com Personally, I'm going to buy the 360 because I couldn't buy it in the summer, or last year... It's rare to find a parent that understands gaming...","Wii probably. play and amazon sold out in minutes and shops have been forced to stop taking pre-orders (this is in the UK), the ps3 seems to be too expensive and wii has captured peoples imagination","yeah the wii seems like it might be kinda wack, i think the 360 will probably sell more, mostly for the fact that they should be easier to find","360. Not because it should. But because it could. PS3s are not enough in stores, and same with the wii. People might end up getting a 360 (although its a year old) just so they dont go home empty handed.

The Wii is for real fun when you have free time. It's for the gamer thats sick of button combinations. The graphics aren't to die for but the gameplay is good. It's current Smash Hit is Zelda: Twillight Princess. It's a good buy for $250 The PS3 to me looks ok (im a huge Sony hater but I'll give it the best props that I can.) Going with the  Six Axis controller I thought was a bit of a knock-off from the Wii, but from playing Resistance: Fall of Man at a friends house, it's seems to work pretty well. The graphics seem pretty balanced w/ the 360. To me though, 500-600 bucks is way too expensive. It's current big hit is Resistance: Fall of Man. I'm a 360 owner and have been since it came out. All I can say is that I'm impressed. The online network is great, an area that 360 shines in. Xbox Live Marketplace is great because you can download game demos, videos, and trailers. Also, you can personalize youself and the 360 dashboard with gamer pictures and themes. By the way, the rumors about the 360 only being able to run for an hour then overheating aren't true cause I've played mine for 6 hours straight at my party and nothing bad happened. Some of the graphics for the games aren't the best but they do have a lot of games worth playing. Its a great buy for 300-400 dollars.

But if you wanna play with friends, download demos, trailers, movies, music, and so much more for only about $60 a year with xbox live, then the 360 is for you. The controls are real comfortable and easy to adjust to. The playstation 3 controls suck and has no vibration. As for the wii, all i can say is that nintendo was thinking very creatively. I suggest not to buy the ps3 at all because it does not compare to the abilities and services the 360 offers you. Dont listen to the fanatics that say, 'ps3 is the best' because its not when you look deeper than its looks and popularity. Dont be stubborn and ignorant cause if you do, you'll end up buying a $600 ps3 like all the other idiots wasting their money for a cheap system. If you wanna make a decision, i suggest you researching the specs and facts about the hardware and services that each of the consoles offers you. Then find the one that matches you. DONT RELY ON POPULARITY ALONE! rely on the facts and not the opinions. As a matter of fact, dont even rely on me, although i do focus my opinions on the facts i have been researching before i bought my 360. Just rely on what you want and not what others want. Thats what i did, and i couldnt be happier with my decision. So to sum it all up, dont follow others and end up buying something thats crap...(cough) PS3,,,,(cough)...instead, lead your own decision and forget about what other people say, as long as your happy with what you got. i hope this helps you and i apologize for writing so damn much but if it prevents you from making a stupid decision, then im gald i could help.",Ps3 no doubt.

Short answer, Best System = PS3 ; Best Games = Wii","There are definately pros and cons for both of these systems. But I believe that Nintendo will be the victor. Although the Wii does not have the graphical muscle, it does have a revolutionary way to play the games with the new remote scheme. Although the PS3 also has this to some extent; only two axis, as opposed to the Wii which has full 360 degree axis. Many people say that Sony got wind of this and tried to copy it at the very last second. Also, it takes great games to make any game system fly. Nintendo has a great reputation for pumping out these games (Super Mario series, Zelda series) and also has awsome third-party support. And even better, the Wii is backward compatible with all the GameCube titles currently published. PS3 does not support this because of it's Blue-Ray technology. Some might say that they are buying the game system and getting Blue-Ray DVD player for free, but this isn't so. The Blue-Ray DVD system is the reason why the price is so high. It makes up about 80% of the price. And good luck finding Blue-Ray DVDs out there, they are so scarce that it's not even worth it. So in the end, Wii wins hands down. Can't wait to get my hands on one.",for me ps3 is more better because of tghe nice specs......,"I would lean toward the Wii, also because: 1. It looks like the better value.  Half the price of a PS3 and backed by a reputable company like Nintendo which knows how to develop a product line. 2. The controller is groundbreaking.  Get the Wii and you'll be holding a true 'next-gen' product.  I'm betting that the revolution in game consoles has begun with the Wii. I like Sony products, but they seem to be more about design.  The specs of PS3 are attractive, but when the 'rubber meets the road', opinions may change.  Look at the DS vs. PSP battle.","Me personally I dont like any of the games coming out for the PS3 - nothing floats my boat. On the other hand, with 334 games out for the Wii, there are tons of titles I want to play. So my vote is for the Wii.","i also like the wii more, it costs less and looks just as fun... also the controller is kind of cool"
ps3,wii,"which system is better:ps3,xbox360 or nintendo wii?","The PS3 isn't out yet.. so I can't see a lot of answers for that.. however I can say, I love the PS2, though I hear the XBox is good.  I haven't tried the NWII, but I think its most likely good, but not as good as the other two.",it depends on what u like i would say the xbox360 because it has more games,ps3 no doubt about it  theve seen what microsoft can do so they can do better,"I think the PS3 will be great because of the DVD player they put in it and the Wii is great because of the motion to it.  I don't care for XBOX at all because it doesn't have any good games like the playstation or the wii system will (i am going off the current gamecube games available).  I won't be buying on anytime soon, mainly because it isn't worth the hassle from not enough being put out in time for the holidays.  I will get them in a couple years.",the PS3 because it has 10x better graphics and it has a built in dvd plater and radio.,"I would have to say that the ps3 is going to be the best. It WILL end up having twice as much games as 360 and the graphics will br just as good or better. Just give the ps3 a little time, the games will start coming out the wazoo in a couple months. (also, according to the geek, the ps3's processor is indeed a bit faster.)","I think the Wii. Its remote has motion sensors so in a driving game you steer with it like a driving wheel, and in a game were you use a sword you swing it like a sword. For more info go to Nintendo.com.",ps3 no doubt,"(I've had the privilege of playing both the Wii and the PS3 earlier this year at a gaming convention, so I'm working off of my knowledge of both of these consoles) While the PS3 features better graphics than the XBOX 360 or Wii, it's obviously the most expensive at $500 or $600. It does include a Blu-Ray player (Blu-Ray is a fancy new kind of disc), however it's not even guaranteed that Blu-Ray will catch on (Sony is the company really pushing it) as it is competing with HD-DVD. Many developers are staying clear of developing games for PS3 due to its high development costs and low supply. For example, Electronic Arts, an extremely large game developer, has decided to dedicate 40% of its efforts to Wii, 40% of its efforts to XBOX 360, and 20% of its efforts to PS3. Many hardcore gamers will choose PS3, however, due to its more mature content library. It's more of a digital media device or computer than a gaming console. XBOX 360 is a successful console, and definitely the best for online play with its XBOX Live network. It has a very diverse library of games available, and it will continue to have some great games for a while. Its graphics are advanced as well. An add-on is now available that plays HD-DVDs, which analysts estimate will slightly overtake Blu-Ray discs to become the popular disc format in the future. The Nintendo Wii is an entirely different ballgame. It's the least expensive of the consoles, at $250. It's also the least powerful graphics-wise. What it lacks in graphics, it makes up for in gameplay. It introduces an entirely new way of playing games - the controller has fancy motion-sensors built in as well as a pointing device. With this, instead of pressing buttons like you would with a traditional controller, you swing the controller like a tennis racket, slash it like a sword, swoosh it through the air like a football pass, or hold its sides and steer it like a steering wheel. With its Virtual Console feature, you can download over 20 years of classic games from NES, SNES, N64, Sega Genesis, and TurboGrafx consoles. Many developers have flocked to Wii due to its new and unique capabilities, as well as its popularity. Like the 360, the Wii will have a very large number of games being released for a long while as well. In the end, its truly up to you to decide which one is better. The PS3's graphics look excellent, but from first-hand experience I can say that the Wii is more enjoyable to play. After using the Wii's motion controls, playing games on regular controllers with buttons feels unnatural.","At this time, I'm tempted to say the Xbox 360, for the following reasons: 1) it's considerably cheaper, 2) there's a better selection of games, and 3) my present understanding is that graphics on the PS3 are only marginally better. Then again, the PS3 hasn't come out yet, so perhaps this opinion is somewhat premature.  As for the Wii, I can't really comment, as I know very little about it besides the fact that it's going to be very small (about the size of three DVD cases stacked together), and it will make extensive use of motion detecting controllers.","Since technical info has already been said, I'll just add my personal opinion here, plus a few things i've read. Both X360 and PS3 are only focusing on improving graphics. All games are the same as PS2 and XBOX games, the oly difference being the graphics. Now: You may consider that wonderfull, I personally don't. Wii not only will revolution gameplay with its new controller, but also all the games are innovative and unique. Lot of big companies are working on exlusive titles for wii, plus some titles that were being developed for PS3 were cancelled. On the other hand X360 is not doing very well with sales. Also: What do you consider to be more realistic? Graphics that look a bit more like the real life or moving your hand in order to wing your character's sword? I will for sure but a Wii next week :) Good luck making your choice!","The PS3 isn't out yet.. so I can't see a lot of answers for that.. however I can say, I love the PS2, though I hear the XBox is good.  I haven't tried the NWII, but I think its most likely good, but not as good as the other two.","PS3 It has great graphics, Internet, instant messaging, your able to put movies, music and pictures on it, Blu-ray disk player, DVD player, wireless motion sensored controlling(just like the wii), able to hook up your PSP to it, you can also play PS2 and PS ONe game on it, and there are many great games, like Resistance Fall of Man.  So i'd go with the PS3.","Xbox 360 by a long shot.  Better games, Better online, HD-DVD, and Cheaper than PS3.  The Nintendo Wii is also an exceptional system.",may b PS3,"Depends on what you like. Edit: To dispute the chick below, all consoles can play DVDs and the only reason PS3's will be special in any way is because it is blu-ray and that means the discs are multi-layered giving them the ability to store a lot of information. Although it doesn't really matter because no game needs more than 5gb. The HD-DVD, the one Microsoft supports, stores ~25gb, which no game or movie even needs near the amount to be able to be stored. So you're just wasting cash on the PS3 blu-ray crap. As for the graphics card, PS3 has one slightly better than the Xbox 360 but that would be expected because it came out a year later. Anyways it isn't that much better and the Xbox 360 gaming companies will have a lot more experience with the console and the games so the 360 will be used to its potential."
ps3,wii,Should I get a Wii or a PS3?,"Nintendo Wii
Pros:
- Cheap!
- Controls genuinely unlike anything else we've played
- Bulging launch lineup
- Play classic Nintendo games!
- Bundled with full game, Wii Sports

Cons:
- Limited in graphical realism and sound quality
- Not skewed for more mature gamer crowd
- Unproven controller may not have longevity

Playstation 3
Pros:
- Colossally powerful hardware
- Plays Blu-Ray high-definition movies
- Sure to get lengthy support by top developers

Cons:
- By far the most expensive of the three next-gen contenders...
- Likely to be hardest to find in stores this year","both are good consoles, you cant actualy ask other people to make the choice for you :)",The Wii is just a confusing piece of garbage. I think that even though its very expensive right now you should get the PS3 before the Wii,Wii. Ps3 is a piece of crap.,"I think you should try the Wii, the PS3 is pretty much just a PS2 with better graphics, get a completely different console, have fun and get a Wii.","the Wii is better, its just a new kindda console, i will buy a Wii when its prize is something like 200, ps3 is just the same and the same console as b4, just better graphics, but you should try Wii, it is not like the other ones!","Both are really good consoles but the Wii is better.  There is no real difference between the PS2 and PS3 except for the better graphics and games.  The only reson I would think about getting it would be for the games.  Too bad the games are $60 now.  The Wii is going in a totally different direction with the new controller and has awesome games at launch like Zelda: Twilight.  And like you said it is cheaper and easier to find before Christmas.  Personally, I'd only get the Wii but you seem to really like Sony so if you can afford it you should also wait until next year when there are more PS3s out there.",I'm not promising anything but i heard the ps3 tried to copy the wii with the motion sensitive controller  the Wii is more unique then the ps3 Hope this helps,"You know, until I read '[it] has intrigued me with it's fun games and playability', I was going to say get a 360. But if that's honestly something that interest you, then you should get one. A lot of PS3 gamers are looking for a hardercore experince than the Wii will probably ever offer. So if that's going to be a problem for you, don't bother. If you can appreciate a more laid-back style, get the Wii. It won't convert you, but it will keep you busy and pack enough Wii only games that are well worth it if you appreciate the character of them, not just call them 'kiddy games'. (I am inevetably always older than the people that say this, ironicly.) You seem alright to me, though, so I'd get one and pick up a PS3 one paycheck later than you origionaly intended to.","Get a Wii, I did and i think its the best system yet.  I was a huge sony fan, I was planning on getting a PS3 from day one.  Now I can proudly say I won't buy one even it it sells for $200.  Sony dropped the ball bigtime with PS3.  Lots of people can't stand sony now, I mean seriously, $600 for a console with no games, that play 'blu-ray' movies which nobody owns.  Pfft. Its interseting to note that if you go to any local store, you will notice that 1/2 of PS3 demo units have been pulled.  Why?  Faulty systems, not much interest.  I'm so happy I got the Wii instead you can't imagine. The Wii is the future of gaming.  Developers are psyched, just look at the PS3 vs Wii launch numbers (14 titles vs 63 titles for the Wii).  Everyone and their mother is psyched about getting a Wii, and everyone will own one.  Don't be the last kid on your block without one. I got a Wii and I got 3 games.  Zelda, NFS carbon, Red Steel.  Plus I got original Zelda,  Donkey Kong, and Mario 64 for the Virtual Console.  The Wii is the most fun I have ever had on a console, it trully immerses you in the game. Wii will win this time, it already has.  It has potentially the largest back catalouge ever with Virtual Console.  VC includes but is not limited to NES, SNES, Genesis, N64, Turbografix16, MSX...and it plays Gamecube games!!! I'm telling you its the coolest thing....  Like when the ipod first came out. For $600 (price of PS3) you can get a Wii and 8 games (9 including Wii Sports which is free).  I only bought 3 games, but its still far far less than a PS3 with no games.",Don't go to Walmart they would not selling me a wii? I got one to checkout an they said they couldn't sell them for a week but I know they was selling them last night. The lady at the register said she sold one.

ps3,wii,"What should i get the PS3 , xbox 360 or the nintendo Wii ?","This has been said SO MANY TIMES..

No offense but this should either be sticked on top of the question or you should use the damn search option at the top. Now.. Time for my suggestion.

I would rather get the 360, however that's me. So for you.

Depends which kind of gaming you want, wether it be shooting, action, zelda, racing.. etc etc But mainly what divides up the consoles in terms of game is that the age group of the games. The Wii gives you a whole new experience of gaming with the motion controller yet the games are either for family or for kids round the ages of 12, but it's a great FAMILY console. The Xbox is more for older kids around 13 and above, its like a Dad and Son console or just, Son. The PS3 is like the Xbox mixed with the Wii, but it involves more teen games like the Jak Series and Ratchet and Clank, etc etc etc its MAINLY for 13 and above, but those above 18 would most likely enjoy Xbox due to its shooting games like GRAW and Gears of War.
The Wii or the PS3 has a STRONG line up or library of games as the Xbox 360 due to releasing just now, the Xbox 360 has Oblivion, Halo, etc etc and the game of the year GoW. Lot of games to choose from where as the Wii have Zelda, Wii Sports, Madden, Raymond, etc etc etc, not as much choices as the 360 but they're very good games with a whole new experience. The PS3 I would have to say in my opinion has weaker games then the Wii or the 360, but it also depends on what kind of games your looking for, Resistance: Fall of Man is a must have for the PS3 however it seems like the only good game for the PS3 thats currently released, but for both the 360, Wii, and the PS3 more great titles are soon to be released like Halo 3, Call of Duty 3.. Etc..

Now for the secondary entertainment. Game consoles now days arent just for gaming, it allows you to play DVDs, HD support, and music. Etc etc The Wii doesn't support DVD or HD, yet from what I'm hearing the graphics are good nonetheless however it can play other Nintendo games such as the Game Cube games, but I think the motion sensing and the family GAMING makes up for the lack of DVD or movie. The Xbox can play normal DVDs and HDDVD (with an add-on about 200USD -HDDVD-), and it you can connect to your PC if you have Windows Media XP, so basically it comes with a 20GB drive (sold separately unless bought with Premium) which you can upload photos, music, videos, etc etc, and it supports HD. The PS3 is the most powerful console in terms of power out of all of these, it supports HD but from what I'm hearing it has no auto detection so if you play on a HDTV and want to your friends house which has a normal TV you wont be able to play it on the normal TV, it also has the Blu-Ray disc which maybe popular next year or so but I'm fine with the HD DVD, it can also do the same thing as the Xbox in terms of hooking up with the PC and uploading music from Ipods, videos, photos, etc etc. The PS3 also comes standard with the 20GB for the 499USD and a 60GB for 599USD.

Multiplayer is important too, a way for gamers to talk and bash each others brain out with that chain-saw... So... The Wii. I'm not sure about the Wii having multiplayer capabilitys, but I'm sure it does, but along with the multiplayer, you can also go on WiiConnect to download old school games such as Sonic, Mario.. Etc and customize your own avatar or 3D person you use to talk and socialize with others in the Wii World. 
The PS3 is kind of the same but it as more of a powerful multiplayer capability such as Resistance: Fall of Man can have a death match with 40 players, now thats a lot of players to kill and a lot of chances to die, I'm not sure about the PS3 downloading things and such... The Xbox 360 has the most powerful online capability tho, you can basically talk and chat using a headset, a webcam online and form clans and teams, it also has multiplayer Co-Op version for Gears of War. It also allows you to download movie",i like the Wii........its just different from the other games...the controller that is....i cant wait to get one!!!!,"This has been said SO MANY TIMES..

ps3,wii,whats the best the wiii or the ps3?,"PS3 is the best, of course. Nintendo Wii comes at a close 2nd. I'm not a fan of xbox.","The wii is definitely better. I really can't understand why so many people are obsessed with the PS3. Most are probably just people who have only ever liked playstation and refuse to give anything else a chance. Playstation is terribly unreliable. Sony's products have the nasty habit of breaking extremely easily, and that's especially not good when the product is over $600. Besides, Sony has other things to worry about, whereas Nintendo is solely a video game company, so they spend more time making their games for quality. The wii has a motion sensitive controller which will make the games very exciting, and the PS3's motion sensitive controller is pretty much worthless, since they just stole it off of Nintendo and put it together really fast. I think the higher graphic capabilities are negligable, given the $350 difference in price between the two consoles. Besides, the wii's graphics will only get better, while the Playstation's will fall behind. This is inevitable, according to history, because of the major hype Sony always makes about its launches, and the unreliablity and sub-par game quality that later ensues.",the nintendo wii is the best console to me.,i think the wii becuz its cheaper but then the ps3's graphics and stuff are better,"PS3 all the way.

G a m i n g !","See what games are available on each, and choose the one with the best games. H a p p y G a m i n g !","It really depends on what you want. PS3 will be (VERY) expensive, and no, it will NOT play HD DVDs, it will play BLU-RAY DVDs, but who knows how long that format will be around. The 360 will play HD DVDs, which are not compatible with Blu-Ray, and no one knows how the war between those two is going to play out. The Wii will not support either at launch, and no one has said whether there are plans to add support for either in the future. Last I heard, neither the 360 or the PS3 is backwards completely backwards compatible. Both support previous gen games with an software driven emulator, and Sony's previous claims for full backward compatibility have become suspect. The Wii on the other hand, will have 30 'old school' titles (from NES, SNES, Genesis, N64, and Turbo-Grafx 16) available for download at launch, with plans to release many more in the future. They will by far have the BEST backwards compatibility. As for games, third party produces are trying to jump on the band wagon left & right for the Wii. Ubisoft has confirmed 7 at launch, bringing the total to 30 for launch, and 40 by year end (plus downloadable previous gen games). Ubisoft has also confirmed a new Prince Of Persia game for the Wii (the only console a new POP game has been confirmed for at this point). It will also have full GC compatibility, and it will play DVDs, have integrated wireless, a spot for a SD card, and will have ports for 4 GC controllers. At a confirmed $249 price, with 1 million units shipping at launch, and an additional 3 - 4 million before year end, you shouldn't have a problem finding one, whereas the the PS3 may be dificult to find (unless, of course, the $500 - $700 price tag will be a sales deterrent, as some people suspect). All the buzz is that the PS loyalists will be standing in line for the PS3s, but the Wii will be the really hot commodity this Christmas, and should be taking back some market share from Sony and Microsoft. My personal opinion is that the Wii is the best deal for the money, especially if all you want is a game console. Yes, the others will do other things, but it's not like those things can't be bought elsewhere, and personally, I'd rather have my game console separate from my DVD player & other electronics, especially until we know which high definition format will become the standard for DVDs.

I have always enjoyed them very mucho mucho.,XBOX 360 for sure ;o) playstations suck lol (sorry but they do),i think the xbox 360 would be the best... ps3 just came out so there prolly isnt any games just yet and no matter how hard nintindo tries their consoles suck,"DEFINITELY the Wii.

Try finding out which system offers the most games that u like.",xbox 360 ps3 is gay trust me,"360 was the first, but that's actually a downside unless you can corner the market before any competition comes out, Microsoft has not done that and both the Wii and PS3 will have much greater graphics capabilities. Wii looks cool, but having no backwards capabilities will hurt. PS3 will launch with literally thousands of titles due its backwards capabilities plus 21 new games and the possibility of 50 total by Christmas and Blu-Ray. It has enough processing power to theoretically run 1 Wii and 5 360 games at the same time. Price will be the only con for the PS3 in this comparison. In reference to the copying Sony does, BlueTooth is a wireless format for low bandwidth data saying Sony stole the idea from Microsoft is ridiculous. Also, the Wii uses motion to control the game, the PS3 uses and tilting accelerometer which is totally different. No console can be 'gay' they are inanimate object, dumb***."

It will have a wider variety of games like its predecessor. The games are more consistantly fun whereas the 360 and the wii are kind of spotty with few big name games.  The wii looks interesting now but will prove to be aimed to a much younger audience in the future because of the continious mario games and others.  The 360 has only a few big name games and most tend to be first-person shooters.  The rest of the 360 games aren't usually fun and if they are fun they are multi-console games that can be played on the other systems.  A couple games I have played on the Ps3 that are also  on the 360 play better on the Ps3.  Its also a lot more fun with the six axis controller with the new moves that now become available with the motion sensors.  Also, if you're worried about the price just think about what you are getting. This thing is a monster in terms of what it can do.  Also for how many hours you will be putting into this thing(1000s of hours) compared to buying a ticket for a movie ($9.00 give or take) for a two hour movie. which is like saying if you arent gonna put more than 140 hours of usage for this thing then don't get it.

ps3,wii,"what is better ps3, wii ,or the xbox360 and why?","I think the PS3 and the xbox 360 are the two best systems. I don't know which one will be better to buy, because each one has its own unique features. I will buy both.","In terms of which console will be the best... Its an interesting question. In economics, Milton Friedman of the Chicago school of economics observed that as you increase the amount of an input, the utility you derive from each additional unit of input decreases. In other words, you really like the first pizza, the second pizza is okay, the third pizza was just barely worth the money and you wouldn't even consider eating a fourth pizza. What does this have to do with anything? Well, there is going to be a diminishing level of enjoyment you will get out of graphics. As the graphics get better and better, there is less and less enjoyement had over better graphics. Take for example, the evolution of nintendo. From SNES-N64, wow much better 2-D to 3D! From N64-GC, better graphics, but not as revolutionary as from SNES to 64. Basic economic thought aside, I lament both Sony and Xbox for taking such a boring route to their nex-gen systems. Its so safe to just add more processing power, better graphics cards and extra little features. While these systems are indeed powerful, theres nothing really quite innovative about them. They chose the typical path for making a better video game system. I will buy a wii, even after my Gamecube has been siting collecting dust for the past two years while I played World of Warcraft. Honestly, if there was no cool controller thing, I wouldn't have bought any system at all. I've played every console game abazillion times now, from Vincent may cry (haha) to bomberman. If I had a linear controller yet again, I would be bored out of my skull. The wii controller is definately a breath of fresh air in an industry afraid to take risks. Now, I'm not saying you cant have fun with the other systems. Of course you can. Halo for the Xbox 360 almost makes up for the cost of the entire system and you know the PS3 will have a killer lineup of RPGs as they always do. But the question can be phrased simply like this: Do you want to play old games with new graphics, or do you want to play new games with old graphics? The choice is yours.","I think the PS3 and the xbox 360 are the two best systems. I don't know which one will be better to buy, because each one has its own unique features.

ps3,wii,"What should I buy, what one is better? PS3, Wii, XBOX360?","It really depends what you're looking for in a game system.

Graphically, they're pretty much all the same.  The games available for all of them are also pretty much the same (except for the Wii--more on that below).  And it would also depend on your budget.  PS3 is most expensive, followed by 360, and cheapest is the Wii.

The 360 is much better for online gaming.  XboxLive is well established.  The PS3 is online capable but Sony hasn't done much in the way of support for it.  The Wii's online gaming is pretty dismal right now, but Nintendo is working on it.

If you accept Sony's claim that Blu-Ray is the video format of the future, and plan on using your game system to watch movies on, then the PS3 is the way to go.  But remember Betamax?  Sony thought that would work too.  The 360 has an HD DVD player available for it.  Sorry, but I'm unsure of the Wii's video capabilities.

The Wii is the ultimate party game system.  With it's new controllers and party-type games, it is a whole lot of fun.  Nintendo has some great game franchises that are perfect for parties (think Mario Kart).  The nunchaku controller will keep you moving around as you play.  A lot.  Playing the bowling game that comes with it is like going down to the local alley and throwing 10 frames.  Granted, it's a 2 oz. controller, not a heavy bowling ball.

Personally, I would have to go with the 360 as my first system.  It's cheaper than the PS3 and will have most the games I'm interested in.  Sony is slowly losing it's exclusive franchises.  But I do miss Final Fantasy...

I'm definetely going to buy a Wii as a second system though.  There is too much interesting stuff going on with it to not have one.  It's cheap enough to warrant having it in addition to a 360 or PS3.

Hopefully I've said something here that helps you.  I would also recommend buying a couple of gaming magazines and seeing what they have to say about these systems.  It's a big investment, some good research would be advisable.","It really depends what you're looking for in a game system. Graphically, they're pretty much all the same.

Or you can buy the Wii now.",Well Ps3 is a no becuase it has even less production about half and cost about 3 times more.  Xbox360 is a good system with great games and great graphics.  However I would suggest a wii because it is a virtual console.  I mean think would you rather be pushing buttons or slash and swinging your arms.  Plus a wii has more production even though there is still little production.  It's only 250 compared to a ps3 which is 600 and Xbox 360 which is 300.  I strongly suggest a wii to find out when shops like EB are getting a shipment check ps3seeker.com/wii,"It depends on what you want, wii is more price efficent, is E heavy, and simpler to learn the controls. So if your looking for a good family consol, or somthing any guest can play, wii is for you. The PS3 has really good stats proscessing, graphics, ect. And comes with blue ray dvd player (which is a risk, if the HD DVD beats blue ray, you find many compatable dvds). All of this comes with the highest price however. The lineup seems more T heavy than the others. So if you have an older familly, or your getting it for your self, and you don't mind investing a lot more money, the PS3 is for you. The xbox 360 has good stats close to the ps3, for a smaller price tag. It has an advantag, being out longer, of a bigger library, which has shown to be a lot more M heavy than the others.

My advice is to get xbox 360 games now, and get a new console after your new money has rolled in, and the launch rush for the new consoles is over.  If you wait a bit, you'll be able to see more of the games that are released for each console, so you know which systems have the games you want to play.",if you already have a 360 i wouldn't get a PS3 cause xbox far superior than PS3..but i would get a Wii cause off the motion sensor it will give you a different  experience of game play although the graphics won't be as good as 360/PS3...also it isn't that expensive,What's the Wii?I've heard of all the other stuff.,If I was you I would just buy new games.Don't waste your money on a new console.,I'd go with PS3.  ☺,"I'm the kind of person that wants one console, so I would suggest you stick with the XBox and spend the money on games","stick with the Xbox,only the name changes!the games are same!",PS3,Stick with what you have and buy games. There will probably be new versions of all these out again soon!
ps3,wii,"What would you buy? PS3,Xbox360 or the Nitendo Wii?","I was a manager for GameStop for three years, and here is my UNBIASED and NON-FANATICAL opinion!!  The 360 and the PS3 have the same graphical capabilities, and don't let ANYONE try and tell you differently.  I have studied the specs on both and talked with a lot of tech junkies and they all say the same thing.  You can buy a 360 and a Wii for the same price as a PS3 by itself.  That is the way to go.  360 has GREAT games already (e.g. Gears of War, and the PS3 will be a bunch of 360 ports at launch except for Resistance: Fall of Man).  The Wii is concentrating on gameplay.  Get both of those now and then get a PS3 when the price drops!!!",Wii for me! I've always been a Nintendo fan.,Xbox360.Its the best!,360,Nintendo all the way. there are new features no the wii that were never seen before like the sweet controller setup. Sony and Microsoft just made the graphics better on the new systems.,Wii!!!,id buy a 24 pk of miller lite until the price came down,I would buy a Xbox360,PS3 http://freepsp.wetpaint.com,i will buy all of them!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I made up my mind last year to wait for the ps3, but since then sony has anounced that when they finaly get round to releasing it in europe they want about £600 for it & £50 for half a game (you buy the rest online). The Wii is fine if you want to chase bunnies through a magic forest on a mushroom made by pixies, but i want to kill things and drive things, so i got myself a 360 and i coundnt be happier",mrs buyin my 360 for crimbo sick of waitin but got name down at play.com for ps3 so both eventually,It will have to be the Wii. Its different from any other consual and more fun. Nintendo Games are always more admasive then other games on the maket and they are not scard to try something new unlike the other game companys that just release a game using the something of the other engen and ideas stollen from this game. Its sad but its true.,Having already got the Xbox 360 I couldn't be more happier. The graphics are pretty much the same as what the PS3 is plus you get to decide to get the next generation DVD playing drive. Also Microsoft announced that they are going to offer you TV shows to download and Movies to rent over Xbox Live. I've also ordered a Wii as they just look fun. Nintendo looks to have gone in a different direction to Sony and MS concentrating on Game play and unique controllers. I think they must of realised that they can't compete when it comes to graphics so why not produce a system which either a 360 fan or PS fan would consider to buy as well.,"I was a manager for GameStop for three years, and here is my UNBIASED and NON-FANATICAL opinion!!

At least by that time each device will have been on the market for a while, had some time to reach it's market share and have a range of titles behind them. You would be able to make a more informed decision as to which one is right for you. I'm guessing that the PS3 will become king. Sony are big contenders in the market, Nintendo have a good pedigree but can make some awefull mistakes and Micro$oft......well the XBox 360 has had it's problems with heat and noise but is a nice piece of kit.  ."
ps3,wii,"Which is better, a Wii or a PS3???","In my opinion, a Wii. 

The PS3's are really overpriced, but for hard-core fans it's probably worth it to them. It's mainly that expensive because of the Blu-ray disc capability. [ More info on Blu-ray: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blu-ray_Disc ]

The Wii also has a better sensor system, better than PS3 (the movement detection capabilities)

Hope that helped!","In my opinion, a Wii.  The PS3's are really overpriced, but for hard-core fans it's probably worth it to them. It's mainly that expensive because of the Blu-ray disc capability.

I like  the wii better because remakes for certain nintendo games are coming out. (did someone say NiGHTS into dreams?) The ps3 is just gonna have all the games the wii has, (the wii has more, however) minus all the remakes. The ps3, in and of itself, is a big waste of cash. Buy a wii instead!",ps3,"PS3 is much better, without thinking, and it's shown on its price (more expensive). Even its graphics is much stronger than Wii.","well, it all depends on what you like in gaming. nintendo has always been for kids and people that like to play games occationally. they always have games for kids, like super mario. don't get me wrong, its also for adults, but usually for adults they have like high-end jobs, and only play games on their spare time.  playstation has a high reputation with really good games over the past like 10 years. the playstation games range from kiddie to full-blown adult games. they have high-named companies with them, like square-enix, so they tend to have more exclusive games. if both aren't your thing, then go for the xbox. xbox has the most shooters in its company. plus they have the most adult games. xbox has been known for its very pretty graphics, but with the new playstation, it all depends on the eye of the beholder. with the pricing, that can also vary too.  if you 'have' a life that doesn't revolve around gaming, go for the nintendo wii. it cost only $250, making it the most affordable gaming system. if you're not going to play often, then why bother with the other 2 right? if you like gaming, and like shooters and M rated games, then go for the 360, starting at $300 to $400. it won't burn a hole through your pocket, and it has the most games as of right now, so more to choose. if you're like me, with no life, love rpgs, and/or simply fell in love with the playstation, go for the PS3. don't let the price scare you, even though its $500-$600, it's probably the most advanced gaming system out there. as time will pass, they will have more games, and maybe even lower the price a little. for the long run, its also your choice. if you have kids:       stay away from the xbox 360 (try finding anything friendly, lol)       choose your game wisely for the PS3, based on the PS2 generation, they will have a lot of games       best option for kids is definately nintendo wii shooter nerd (lol):       nothing beats xbox       they got some good ones for the PS3       might be hard to find in the later times on the nintendo wii round gamer (you play almost everything):       might be hard to find a good platform or rpg game on the xbox 360       by this time next year, the PS3 will probably have a least one good game in every genre       nintendo wii, its more into the kid friendly games, but still has some good games in some genre so really its all up to you. you have a life and don't like spending money, get the nintendo wii. gamer that doesn't wanna lost all their money, the xbox 360 is for you if you're the above average gamer, know the ps3 will have one of the best games out there in like a year, and don't mind burning a hole in your pocket, get the playstaion 3. (p.s. sorry if my girl-ness came out in that answer xD)","well, it is really a point of view type of thing. if your the kind of person who goes for graphics, good action and shooting games, go for the ps3. if you really like adventure and rpgs, don't care about TOP graphics (the wii's graphics are better than the ps2 and i think xbox, not too sure) and the dvd, blu-ray, or hddvd compatability, and like the wiimote (cool as hell by the way) go for the wii.",a Wii. its the first of its kind to be sold all over. a ps3 is like all the other systems.,definetly a wii because it costs 250$ not 500$ and plus all the tax for the ps3 is 8 cents per dollar that's about another 200 dollars and the wii hase motion sensores but on the ps3 can u play boxing on it like in real life. no but on the wii u can play any sport as if u where in it so get a wii not a ps3,"PS3, better graphics",Wii
ps3,wii,Why do you think the Nintendo Wii could win the PS3 and Xbox?,"It COULD win due to the crowd it is playing to, its innovative style, its incredible gaming selection however, it wont because: The PS3 has more aspects that appeal to the public. This is not from the point of view of sony, or microsoft or even nintendo, it is from the point of view of a gamer: The ps3 it may cost alot but it can already run linux and if it can run linux then surely it can run xp and if it can run xp surely it can emulate xbox and if it can emulate xbox then surely with its graphical capabilities it can emulate xbox360 and with that comes halo 3. If it can emulate halo 3 and it has the same technology as the wii then surely sony will find a way so that it uses that technology and it will most likely be similar to the wii. If not the homebrew community will emulate something similar to the wii and if you are patient and wait a few months for the ps3 then you will have killed 3 birds with one stone essentially. You will have a console that can emulate xbox and xbox360 and the wii. Now stop if you got an xbox360 and a wii you would be able to do almost everything the ps3 can do with the exception, you will lack blu ray a new and rising format, you will lack the memory space that the ps3 has, you will lack the graphics the ps3 has, you will lack the computer like capabilities the ps3 has, and you will lack the ps3 selection of games which is available to soley the ps3. Now if you can live without all that then get an xbox360, but if you can wait and have patience you can have it all.","It COULD win due to the crowd it is playing to, its innovative style, its incredible gaming selection however, it wont because: The PS3 has more aspects that appeal to the public.

Wii is really fun, because YOU are a part of the game, you arent just staring at the screen while mashing buttons. It also has free wi-fi. Go to it's official site, you'll get more detailed reasons.","Well duh! I've heard that you can  play a PS3 for only 30 minutes and then it freezes-it NEVER unfreeze after that! And XBOX is bor-ring! Wii rules! And seriously, I have been into electronics for a VERY long time!","At the end of the year, the PS3 will be a distant 3rd place in terms of market share. There just aren't enough systems to go around Nintendo will be in second place, with nearly all of the 4 Million systems on the market finding homes. But that won't be enough to catch up with the 7ish Million XBox already has in homes, and they will have the greater market share. By the end of the first quarter of '07, Sony will have retaken the market and sit comfortably in the #1 spot, assuming they don't have any major production disasters. Nintendo and Xbox will be in a dead heat. I'm giving Nintendo a slight advantage, here. I think with the Wii's reasonable price they'll be a bit more resistant to the post-holiday slump. With the sheer quantity of systems out there since the release, developers will be plentiful and they'll be eager to see who comes up with the most natural control system and what kind of new franchises they can stake out. It's really a coin-toss though."
ps3,wii,"what got better reviews between xbox360,ps3,wii?",PS3,"It really depends on what you are looking for in a system, as all of the systems have had good reviews, bad reviews, and some mixed. The only thing that I can add is that you will be hard pressed to find negative reviews for the Wii out of reviewers that have actually tried the system.  Basically Wii's only real downside is that the graphics are not as good as a PS3 or 360, since it doesn't support anything higher than 480p. Many reviewers have showed the system to non-gamers, and I have yet to read about a non-gamer that didn't like it. By the same token, I have heard very few gamer types that have tried it and not liked it, and most of those that didn't did not spend very much time with it. My recommendation would be to get your hands and try each system yourself, but my bets are on the Wii, which actually a safer bet considering it costs less to begin with.",yes xbox makes you pay an extra 200 bux for the HD player but remember you only paid about 400 bux retail for it and ps3 is 600 bux...add the prices and you get the same EXACT price,PS3,"well i dont know what reviews you mean. there are reviews on certain websites, but they are very unreliable, they just give positive comments to the company that pays them the most. i work at gamestop and i get emails from customers that have played their consoles. about 60% of people were dissapointed with their 360. and 20% were dissapointed with their PS3.  here's my review. and iv'e played all of them. PS3 all the way. lets consider the differences.  PS3 has full HD support. neither the Wii or the 360 have anything close to that. PS3 has blu-ray compatibility. The Wii has nothing of the sort. and the 360 requires you spend $200 to play HD DVDs which arent even as good as blu-ray discs. Ps3 can store up to 60GB of music movies and games. 360 can store 20GB and Wii can store jack ****. Ps3 had games like resistance, Lair, Full auto 2, Motorstorm. the only good game of the 360 is halo 3, which wont be here until next november. PS3 has the option of HDMI, AV, Coaxial, or component output, the 360 gives you one cable that will use either A/V or Component, and they have the nerve to call the component output HD. wii makes you use AV. The Blu-ray discs used for PS3 games make the games enormous, and worth much more time. i beat gears of war on the 360 in 9 hours. i have been playing resistance for 12 hours and i am about one quarter the way through. the Wii isn't even worth mentioning here, all their games are aimed at children and can be finished with within 4 hours.  there is really no question as to which is better. the only reason you may hear negative things about the PS3 is because people have decided to jump on some PS3 hating bandwagon. they are the same ignorant dipshits that barge into best buy to buy an iPod without considering other players by creative.  'Gotta get an iPod, thats what everyone else has, everyone hates the PS3, i gotta hate it too' come on, grow up, get your own opinion.","How can you say the 360 dosn't have any good games but Halo 3 Britian. Do they not ship games there like Gears of War, Oblivion, Ghost Recon and Dead Rising. If any console dosn't have good games its the PS3 which has absoultly no good games and don't have many titles that are even exciting. The PS3 is very difficult for developers to make games for and Sony relies almost exclusivly on 3rd party developers. Reminds me of another system Dreamcast. I want my VIDEO GAME SYSTEM to play games. If I wanted a hightech dvd player I would buy a high tech DVD player. The Wii hopfully will be the top system Nintedo gets it they don't have all the bells and wistles but when it comes down to it their games are fun to play allowing people to download old NES, SNES, N64 games and play online. Also Sony has ripped off Nintendo for years and years the motion sensor controler for PS3 is a joke it was developed in 2 months only after the Wii was unveiled. Nintendo waited purposely so sony couldn't steal from them again the ps3 was shown with regular controlers and all the graphic upgardes a few days later the wii came out to show off their cool controlers. Sony stole the idea and added the feature to their designs just as they did the analog stick and rumble feature for playstation. Playstation fan boys will continue to eat up sonys products and to answer the orginal question its hard to review systems the PS3 is better in everyway to the other systems on paper but the reviews come down to the games so in order its  1. Xbox 360 (year head start tons of software and good games avialible) 2. Wii (Zelda best game of holiday season other than GoW plus revolutionary control with Wii sports makes for fun games) 3. PS3 (Fantastic Machine, but lacks the software also is not fully compatible with PS2, PS games as first thought. Not as much on horrizon as other 2 systems.)"

ps3,wii,"Which Console will be better? PS3,Xbox360 or the Nintendo Wii?","Nobody here plays online obviously.  If you are an online gamer, then the 360 is the hands down winner.  Sony has never been able to put together an online gaming model.  And I don't expect that will change with the PS3.  Xbox Live, on the other hand, is over 1 million subscribers strong.  In less than 2 weeks, HD movies will be available for download to the hard drive.  So you will be able to watch HD movies without ANY HD drive, Blue-Ray, HD, or otherwise.

If you are going to connect the console to the internet and game online, you have to go 360.  Xbox Live is the bomb.","You should look things from different perspectives... No console is absolutely best, they all are more or less suited to a user's habits. You want to play games, but don't want/need a DVD player and are on a 'tight' budget? Wii is the answer You want to play lots of games, don't care about High Definition movies playback but want to see all your PC content on a TV? Then go for the Xbox 360 (MediaExtender, of course you need a Microsoft Windows Media Player Edition on your PC). You want the best possible game resolution and a High Definition DVD player (Blu-Ray DVD)? Then you should go for the PS3. The question is not: which is best... But rather: which is best FOR ME :-) Also... Which one will your friends purchase (you might also be able to exchange titles...) Take care",impossible to answer untill ps3 comes out.....,"Far too many tech heads talking in here. It doesnt matter about which format has the best specs, just how much fun they are to play in a group. Wii wins hands down. Also, be serious, can you honestly say any game is going to be better than zelda? I think not.","It'll depend on the individual, 360 has been out a long time now and well established, Nintendo Wii will appeal who want to change the way in which they play video games atr home. PS3 will have some catching up to do with the 360 by the time it's released. Think they've made a major blunder by not releasing it before xmas in uk !","It basically depends on what type of games appeal to you. Nintendo tend to cater for platform/puzzle/Mario games, and the other platforms tend to cater more for action/driving or any type of game which requires graphics processing power. The Nintendo Wii is on its own with its unique controller, but the 360 and PS3 will probably compete against each other. The XBox 360 has a head start because its been out for longer, and is much cheaper. Soon, the HD DVD drive will be out for the 360 and it remains to be seen what effect that will have. The PS3 appears to be technically superior. However, if its overpriced and in short supply to begin with then people may be put off.","the Nintendo is completely different to the other two, and the PS3 is more powerfull than the 360.... Even though it isnt out yet... PS3 all the way.... I want one! NOW!",PS3 by far according to independant review on the Gadget Show the other day...,Have to agree that ps3 WILL be the bomb,PS3 judging by all the statistics and pre-release reviews,"definitely PS3, just look at all the things this thing can do...Xbox 360 and Wii simply dont have tech to compete with the PS3","As an X-Box owner I have to say, unfortuantly the best option will be the PS3 no matter what anyone tells you.","Too many people are giving the PS3 credit before it's due.  From a technical standpoint, the PS3 will have many problems.  Blu-Ray is a very poor design and will cause many headaches from media going bad.  That and the cost of the PS3 will hold it far behind the others.  PS3 will be good, but it's impossible at this time to determine if it's better, or even as good as the other two major players.  In modern console gaming, the concept of exclusive titles is dying.  So in that alone, I'd go for the unit with the best bang for the buck.  You can have both the Xbox360 and a Wii for the price of a PS3. Here's a list of some of the PS3 problems: - Blu-Ray is going to be a big problem for the PS3.  Don't buy it to play movies, because you won't be able to without the correct equipment.  It won't play movies on just any TV. - Expensive.  Both to buy and to maintain.  Expect $70 to $100 games for the PS3 very soon.  Sony is expected to loose about 2 billion in the first year alone from the PS3, so they'll have to make up ground by over charging for games. - Really not more powerfull than the competition.  The PS3 was designed over 1 year ago, so on it's market debut, it's already past prime in terms of Moore's law.  It's process, though differently laid out, is functionally identical to both the other consoles. (all are based on the same IBM PowerPC chip.)  And the graphics engines in both the 360 and the PS3 are functionally identical. Sony is in a world of hurt.  The PS3 would have been a great machine if it had been released on time, without the ill-fated blu-ray drive.  All the so-called 'hype' right now is only there due to Sony's massive advertising initiative.  Once these machines hit the market, and the Sony ad machine starts to run out of money, expect it to start to fail on the market.  Be sure to read the linked stories.  Google or Yahoo for 'sony ps3 failure' and you'll find tons more.  Many of them are from prodomonant media sources.

ps3,wii,which one is the best system ps3 or the wii????,DEFINITLY the Wii the PS3 seems almost exactly the same as the PS2 except the graphics...i mean i think video game systems should be designed to play games...not act like a computer and just get bigger hard drives etc...to me that is just boring,"Well 2 completely different things the ps3 has great graphics and is more of a multi media system. DVD,MUSIC,INTERNET,ECT. But does lack in good games compared to nintendo with there huge hits such as zelda mario donkey kong all those great things and the wii is so inovative its truly amazing i have one since launch and i have  ps3 trul i think ill be playing games more on the wii but watching movies and just chillin on my ps3. But ive already lost weight with wii sports boxing lol.",Wii....Zelda....addictive...good god that game has been haunting my dreams...AHHHHHHH.  The Wii is awsome especially the bowling...,DEFINITLY the Wii the PS3 seems almost exactly the same as the PS2 except the graphics...i mean i think video game systems should be designed to play games...not act like a computer and just get bigger hard drives etc...to me that is just boring,"I don't own a PS3, mostly because I couldn't afford one, but of the two, I was much more excited for the Wii. I got one on launch day and it's been on pretty much non-stop. Ha ha!! So for me, I'm definately voting the Wii as the best.",Wii,It all depends on what your looking for. Granted the PS3 does have Extremely Great Graphics but Considering you can get EVERY game for the PS3 on Xbox 360 thers really no sense in getting one. Untill they have original games coming out.. its not worth getting a PS3. Nintendo Wii on the other hand is a different story. It still has some of the same games as the 360 but with the Unique controller you have a better experience with the game like Madden '07. so Price aside i would still have to go with the Nintendo Wii. The Nostalgic Games you can download with Wii Points is a plus also. Not to mention you can download the Opera Web browser for free untill June '07 . after that its only $25 which isn't bad.,wii 250 control rocks,"I love the wii better for it's simplicity, and the movements involved in the game experience. I used to favor ps3 more, but after I saw all it's commercial, It made be like the wii better. If you are into high end gaming, ps3 is the way to go if you have the time."
ps3,wii,"Who will win the next gen war PS3,360,or wii?","There are many fanboys answering this question, but the only true answer is that nobody can know.

The 360 has set itself up as a very well designed system with a potential to come out on top. It certainly has done several things right, but the most important being its online capabilities.

The PS3 is set up, in my opinion, to be a real disappointment. The fact is that, for at least a few years, it cannot live up to the hype(cell processing is not only experimental, it is called pointless by most programmers and game developers HATE developing for it, in general. It's a pain to program for). That, coupled with scandal within Sony, and the fact that it wont reach widespread accessibility until Spring of next year, makes the PS3 look like a flop. I don't even want to get into all of the PR follies Sony has made, but the ""just get a second job"" comment and the suggestion that Nintendo stole the motion sensing idea from them jump immediately to mind.

Nintendo stands to absolutely make the most money this quarter. From a retail standpoint, the Wii is a much better sale (higher margins for retailer, lower cost, etc...). Nintendo can also make money on each console, versus the loss Microsoft and Sony take on their consoles. This ties in very nicely with the fact that there will be so many Wii available this quarter, so people going in to buy a PS3 will, most likely, walk out with a Wii. And the Wii looks like FUN.

What are people going to spend the most money on? PS3. No contest. One word. eBay.

But as for a long-term winner, I look at the details and say that Wii in the right place at the right time. I think that all of the systems have a chance, but to call the whole thing a war is unfair. What constitutes winning? Most financial gain will definitely go to Nintendo. Most consoles sold will probably go to Nintendo as well. Best graphics will go to PS3 in the long run, but they are likely to fail in all other areas. And the 360 is certainly the console which has shown widespread appeal. But the whole contest is highly subjective, and to call it a war is just unfair. Perhaps a better question to ask would be, ""What constitutes winning the console war?""",ps3!!,"It will be PS3, then Wii, then 360","wiiiiii, no contest whatsoever noob.","ps3, it will live up to the hype",Playstation 3.,im going to have to go with thePS3,"360, first of all whoever pays $600 for a PS3 is out of theyre mind anyone with common sense can see that, the Wii is more aimed for the younger crowd as most nintendo consels are. And the reason why the 360 would win is because older gamers are coming into the gaming world. 360 = intense violence games which most older gamers aim for","There are many fanboys answering this question, but the only true answer is that nobody can know. The 360 has set itself up as a very well designed system with a potential to come out on top. It certainly has done several things right, but the most important being its online capabilities. The PS3 is set up, in my opinion, to be a real disappointment. The fact is that, for at least a few years, it cannot live up to the hype(cell processing is not only experimental, it is called pointless by most programmers and game developers HATE developing for it, in general. It's a pain to program for). That, coupled with scandal within Sony, and the fact that it wont reach widespread accessibility until Spring of next year, makes the PS3 look like a flop. I don't even want to get into all of the PR follies Sony has made, but the 'just get a second job' comment and the suggestion that Nintendo stole the motion sensing idea from them jump immediately to mind. Nintendo stands to absolutely make the most money this quarter. From a retail standpoint, the Wii is a much better sale (higher margins for retailer, lower cost, etc...). Nintendo can also make money on each console, versus the loss Microsoft and Sony take on their consoles. This ties in very nicely with the fact that there will be so many Wii available this quarter, so people going in to buy a PS3 will, most likely, walk out with a Wii. And the Wii looks like FUN. What are people going to spend the most money on? PS3. No contest. One word. eBay. But as for a long-term winner, I look at the details and say that Wii in the right place at the right time. I think that all of the systems have a chance, but to call the whole thing a war is unfair. What constitutes winning? Most financial gain will definitely go to Nintendo. Most consoles sold will probably go to Nintendo as well. Best graphics will go to PS3 in the long run, but they are likely to fail in all other areas. And the 360 is certainly the console which has shown widespread appeal. But the whole contest is highly subjective, and to call it a war is just unfair. Perhaps a better question to ask would be, 'What constitutes winning the console war?","PS3 has no chance of winning at all.  Its between 360 and Wii. Wii is abundunt, cheap, fun and simple.  I say Wii, but the 360 has a chance too... PS3 no way.",wii will win due to low cost.  360 will also do will. P3 will lose out.,PS3 definately  the only thing they will have to overcome is the price >.<,"for awhile the Wii, though I think with price drops and new games PS3 will come out on top.","I think it will be a very tight race between the Wii and the Xbox 360.  Both are going for a different group and they are both cheap enough not to break your bank.  Wii may have a lead i must say because of all the new stuff that is packed into that mini machine.  The PS3 however seems to me like a Xbox 360 with a diamond coating.  They didn't really add that much to the system and it is expensive as heck.  If you are cheap and looking for fun, go Wii.  If you got the cash and want some serious FPS and sports go with the 360.  PS3, useless.","I think the Wii is going to do really well because its so cheap compared to the other 2, and its abundant availability. But we wont know who really wins until years from now.  I think when Mario Kart comes out for the Wii, it will all be over!!!",My vote is for the WII,"I hope that the Xbox 360 will win, but I'll bet that the PS3 and Wii will probably come in 1st and 2nd.  The Wii has the new innovative controller and the low price tag on it's side.  The PS3 has more processing power.  But the Xbox 360 in my opinion is best system and should win the console war.  I hope that the PS3 crashes and burns because it is stealing ideas from the other consoles and is not playing fair in the console war.","Wii is looking like a real contender. Sony will probably be behind the pack due to delay in production, higher price and tarnished image due to the laptop battery fiasco."
ps3,wii,what is better a ps3 or a nintendo wii?,NINTENDO Wii OMG !!!!!! I can't wait to play zelda!...total interaction!.....,nintindo because the ps3 are having troubles with everything they cant even play ps1 or ps2 games,"Nintendo Wii. Its opinions but I deeply followed nintendo since day 1. I think Sony is unveiling a new era of graphics but the games cost to much, I dont care aboutb system price, to be honest the Wii is a little out of my price range. But title value is what matter.",NINTENDO Wii OMG !!!!!! I can't wait to play zelda!...total interaction!.....,ps3,"Wii hands down. Better gameplay, innovative controller, new genre of games, not to mention the release of SSBB soon! Red Steel is also there, along with Call of Duty 3(Which, although being for the PS3 as well, feels more real with the Wii controller.)",PS3 Definitely! If you have the money though,nintendo wii..hella awesome,"ROFLMFAO. sorry to break it to you nintendo fan, but PS3!","Depends...  if you want hi-def graphics and all the bells and whistles, PS3 is your best bet.  If you don't care so much about graphics and want a more inclusive and fun game experience, Wii is better. If you don't have a HD TV yet, go with the Wii.  Buying a PS3 and not having a HD TV is like buying a Lamborghini and driving it 25 mph."
ps3,wii,"which should i get wii, ps3, or xbox 360?",go for wii coz it the best of this three ......bro belive me i have tried all three.....,get the wii or the ps3 or the xbox360,go for wii coz it the best of this three ......bro belive me i have tried all three.....,dude get the PS3 look at this website how powerful is the  PS3. www.playb3yond.com,wii,ps3 thats what im gettin,Well...I got all 3 of them. PS3-Doesn`t play all it`s games. X-Box360- Sometimes Freezes (as I been told) Wii- IS SO MUCH FUN DARN IT!  :),"You obviously haven't played Gears of War or Dead Rising for the 360 huh? Listen, the main reason we buy a game system is for the games right? The xbox 360 so far has the best games, The Wii comes in at a close second with games like Zelda and the new Resident Evil: Umbrella Chronicles coming out, (The controller is pretty sweet too), Then it's PS3, the best game out so far is Resistance: Fall of Man and that's it!  I have a Wii and it's freakin awesome, but I've played 360 and I would get it just for 2 games: Gears of War and Dead Rising. So, take your pick: Xbox 360 or The Wii","x box 360 bcuz most games are coming out for both ps3 and 360, plus the 360 is cheaper and get the wii to its fun","it really depends on you.  wii is said to be super fun yet the games are a lil more majority to the youngs ones. i'm not really sure about that. and the games are not that big of a variety. despite the old games from other nintendo consoles which wii is able to play. still, you can customize your photos! on the other side. the ps3 has a great variety of functions; that's the reason for the unholy cost. and if my memory is clear, the newer games will be available for ps3 instead of ps2. it is rather costly but it's worth your money. like the wii, ps3 can also play games from other playstation consoles. on another side. xbox 360 is somewhat a lil bit 'older' then the previous consoles. still, i've heard it's got great graphic. the anticipated Halo 3 is available soon (i guess). and Halo cannot be played on wii or ps3. well, that's very briefly i what i can say. and as you can see most of this is based on my memory. i don't even know what i want! good luck in your choice making!",wii and the ps3 and the 360.,"It really counts on what you like. For example, The xbox 360 has really really good graphics, and tons of games to choose from. The wii is a brand new game, and many people have said that it is super fun.  the playstation 3 also will have more of a selection coming out.",Get what you can afford... PS3 and Xbox 360 will have awesome games coming out in 2007... Wii is a new type of controller that may take the video game market by storm... Its up for grabs really LOL @ the guy that said Halo 3 was gonna be a big hit...maybe he's got the winner to Super Bowl too... Thanks Captain Obvious...,It depends on your tastes. I have the 360 so as long as it keeps coming out with great games i'll stick with it. But i like Zelda so i'll get the WII sometime. But unless both get severaly out done (and the price drops) by ps3 i wont get it.,"I recommend the xbox 360, i heard that its new game, Halo 3, will be a big hit."
ps3,wii,"What console do you like better the Nintendo Wii, PS3, or XBox 360?","360 because it can do so much and it looks great 

then wii because it is Nintendo and it is going to let you play retro game personally i think  that is great 

ps3 is way to expensive plus blue ray is new so you know it is going to brake down plus you remember when it caught on fire at the game fair","wii all the way!!!! real exited about the zelda game... cant say much about the ps3... i wish i could, but with college and tuition, theres only so much i can afford...lol","I can't really judge the PS3 or Wii but I have a Xbox 360 and it is (insert bad word) great! My order would be Xbox 360, Wii, and PS3. Wii looks great because of the interactivity, seems like it will be excellent. The PS3 just looks lame. Not original at all and not even worth 600 dollars. I can buy a big HDTV for that cash. And not to mention the games for it... 'Historic Japanese Battles! Now I'm fighting a giant crab!' Omg... seriously... Sony needs help. And look at Ridge Racer... lmao. So far the games are a joke. But who knows, considering they copied a lot of Microsoft's Xbox 360 features, it will probably be good for that reason.",The Nintendo Wii!!!!!!!!,The Wii all the way. I have had Nintendo all my life and I look forward to the Wii as it is the next step for Nintendo.,360 because it can do so much and it looks great  then wii because it is Nintendo and it is going to let you play retro game personally i think  that is great  ps3 is way to expensive plus blue ray is new so you know it is going to brake down plus you remember when it caught on fire at the game fair,"Xbox 360. then nintendo wii (because i grew up with nintendo, so i'm a nintendo kinda girl.), then the ps3.","Gotta say, i'm excited about the Wii.  It has a lot of possibilities.  PS3, not so much.  I'm a broke college kid, who the hell can afford it?  Besides, none of the games I've seen for it seem interesting enough for the initial outlay.   At least the Wii has Zelda.  XBox 360....  Have they worked out the bugs yet?  I've known a few people who bought it and had it malfunction in the first few months.",The Wii.  Its hands down the best system.  And the most popular too. For $250 you can beat it.  For $600 (price of Ps3 with NO games) you can have a Wii and 7 games.,I like the why you will be able to play games on the WII but the PS3 will have better games most likely and better graphics.,weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!,"Well then, you're a dumbass since the only one anyone can say they like or not is the only one that is already out!

The Wii is my favorite, even though it does not have as good of graphics, it has a price range of $250, and it has 2 controllers that motion sensed.","Get a nintendo wii. It's much cheaper, the remote rocks! And the great graphics might get boring after a while. Think about it. I think the only bad thing is that Wii won't play certain games the 3rd party game companies make like DBZ or WWE games."
ps3,wii,Which r better 1 PS3 OR WII?,ps3 is much better but is not worth the money and the wii is good and isnt overly priced,"It really depends.  The PS3 will have a lot more processing ability's, a lot more raw power, and better graphics.  But WII is going for a whole new level of game play - more active, using hand motion in the game play. Personally, I would get a PS3 for me, and a WII for my <14 year old children.   In the end, it will really depend on what games you like to play.","If you are on a budget and cannot afford $600 + money for games and an extra controller, I suggest you get the Wii.","PS3 for 'Raw Power' and 'processing ability' PS3 'much better' - for what ?  processing ? raw power ? getting yourself broke ?  Better graphics ? - Big Chihuahua !!! - you're still doing exactly what you've been doing for the past 5 years thumbing the X button - only difference is the shinier images..the WOW factor has long since sailed as far as I'm concerned. C'mon guys no disrespect intended here but surely you're losing sight of what it's all about here - Playing games, FUN !!! The Wii according to reports will do this better than anything else purely for the fact that it's new & refreshing way of gaming  Graphics pretty much levelled out for me 2 years ago...

ps3,wii,PS3 vs. XBox360 vs Nintendo Wii?,"I'm going for Nintendo Wii. At a price of $249.99, it won't empty out vault after vault full of money when buying the console, a few games, some virtual console games that will be downloaded into the console, and probably some other things like PS3 or XBox 360 are sure to do. Yeah I exagerated things a little, but compared to buying even the cheaper PS3 of $500, I could get a Wii, 4 games, an extra control, and even a few virtual console games for about the same price. And XBox 360 does not have anything that appeals me. Gears of War looks good, but to me, it feels like a broken record repeating itself. Wii is trying to put you in the game, like Zelda, in which it actually makes you feel as if you are aiming aa bow or slashing a sword. All thanks to the motion sensitve control. But this is my reason for buying it. You should look more into which one you'd like the most. By the way, obviously 360 is out already. PS3 is out November 17 but may be hard to find as shipments are expected to be low. Nintendo Wii comes out November 19, with a very high number of units coming out.",i would get ps3. xbox 360 is cool but its not that different than the xbox. i have never liked nintendo systems. im not sure about the prices,I'd buy the Nintendo Wii because at 249.99 it is so much cheaper and nintendo said they will have like what was it  ethier 29 when it comes out and 62 at the end of next year And you can play DVDs and download Nintendo games up to 20 years ago and The Wii comes with Wii Sports,yea go wit the ps3,"PS3 all the way.

1)it's cheap
2)it has good family games
and
3)it's motion activated",PS3. it has much better graphics(up to 1080p). Better games like resistance: fall of man. it plays blu-ray disk. you can put movies and music and pictures on it. you can browse the web. it is wi-fi and it comes with a 60gb hard drive,for my opinion nintendo wii is better because it has better and a wider viarity of games plus the games and system is cheaper,Well I haven't played either one of them but I would think that the PS3 is better.,wii hands down not only does it cost way less but it'll last way longer i mean come on NINTENDO RULES!!!!!!! soooooo yeah wii,"If you have a tv that has 1080p, and PS3's were $250, then I guess that PS3 would be better.  80% of the tv's in this World displays less than 1080p.

I wouldn't expect Sony to retake the market until Febuary or as late as March, given the problems they're claiming in production. That's not to say they'll lack market strenght, you can fully expect them to be in a dominant position by summer. But this has all left Nintendo with quite an oppurtunity to grab a huge chunk of the market and they are, smartly, marketing the Wii as something many hardcore gamers will have in addition to the PS3.","With the sales of both systems selling out, it seems that the Wii sold more.  Seeing as how Sony only shipped 400,000 systems and Nintendo shipped 4 million.  Strange, huh?  I looked it up on CNN.com.  I'd expect Sony to ship more, seeing all the hype built up for it."
ps3,wii,"Xbox 360, PS3 or Wii? Which should I get?","It all depends...they each have something about them that is different for different people...
as far as the PS3...it has the best graphics and capabilities available for all three, but only 400,000 consoles are being released initially...so if you want this...you will probably have to wait until Christmas time
the Wii is a lot cheaper than both...by about 300 dollars, but the graphics are not as good.  the Wii will also have more of new versions of the main nintendo games...like a new Zelda and things like that, and it has a new and innovative game controller that helps with certain games (like bowling)
the Xbox 360 doesn't have as many capabilities as the PS3, and the graphics aren't supposed to be as good, but the Xbox has been out longer so may have worked out some of the bugs that the other two may initially have.

You can pay 500 for the lower version of the ps3 or the xbox for 600 without the important featureds like wireless internet or if you want to spend less and save on games then go with the nintendo.,good luck getting any of them without a presale...  buy the way i have one on presale first day ill have in hand anyone looking to buy one youll have to pay shipping but email me if interested  uswitchesthree@yahoo.com,u should 4 sure get a ps3 everyone is dieng 2 get one when they come out .  it will be the HOTT!!

Why? because the wii is ofering something that the others don´t, nintendo have fun games and an intuitive and new game experience what they lost is some of the best franchise loke FF or Metal Gear, they complain about the graphics, I dont think that games like legend of zelda or red steel look bad I think that graphics are more than enough. I think you should wait to see the tree runing and then make your desition But also I think that a Wii is a must, and then go for another console that explains so mani ps and xbx Fands around here.","You should get a Wii, not only is it the best system, but its also the cheapest at $250",PS3.  here visit      http://www.playb3yond.com/   and see it for yourself,PS3
ps3,wii,"which is more fun the Wii,xbox360 or ps3?","The Wii of course,
The PS3 is gonna be like the PS2 just the PS3 will have better graphics. The wii is more fun cause u can actually pretend the remote is the sword. For example in Wii sports you play tennis kinda like the way you would play it in real life. The 360 has fun online though its really hard to get connection and lagz a lot. I think sony has no more ideas. The Ps3 will be exactly like the ps2. So there u have it.

Bottom Line: Wii, its feels like ur playing in real life.","Definitely the Wii, it is coming out with originality instead of which system has the best graphics. It is focusing more on the future. Why by a system which is going to be replaced every couple of years? The Wii promises a career in gaming and not to be replaced with just another system, it will also include the entertainment that a system is supposedly supposed to bring it connects the player with the game. However PS3 is bringing competition with its wireless sensible controller. Nintendo has always brought out the fun, with every system. : )","The Wii of course, The PS3 is gonna be like the PS2 just the PS3 will have better graphics.

ps3,wii,"Which video game system do you think will be the biggest seller, PS3, Nintendo Wii, Or X-box 360?","The playstation 3 will, but since they've made so few, it has a limit on how much they can sell. That's why there's all this craziness in trying to get one. I want a Wii, they're cheaper, and they've made a ton more so it probably won't be insane when I try to buy one. If they keep making more PS3s though, then that will definitely be the biggest seller I think.","i think that the 360 will win, followed closely by the wii. on a strictly hardware front the ps3 wins but  its just too expensive and the wii just doesn't compare to the technology of the ps3....the xbox 360 is the best middle ground","I'm interested to see how everything plays out.   First of all you have the Wii which comes in at a lesser price, the opportunity to download classic games (which it seems is what people are talking about a lot lately games that have replayabilty and were just so much fun back then), and the new way of playing with the new controller which is going to revolutionize the way we all play games. Second you have the PS3 which has such a hefty price even for the stripped down version.  Hardware wise yeah better but at what cost.  They are sticking with the blue-ray technology but what happens if everyone else desides to go with the HD technology?  Everyone who bought a PS3 will be screwed cause the disks wont be as mass produced and the cost of games will go up, plus the blue-ray player will be worthless cause it wont play HD disks. Third and certainly not last you have the 360.  While everything is being released now the 360 is in its second generation or games.  Developers know the software and know how to make the games better.  Just look at whats out and going to be coming out soon (Gears of War, F.E.A.R., and of course Halo 3).  The price is between the other two and with big games coming up with graphics which are almost identicle to PS3. In my opinion I would have to cast my votes as a close tie between Wii and 360 with PS3 pulling up the rear cause of the shortage of systems, and big price.",I HAVE a PS3..if you are one of those morons paying more than retail for it..you are gonna be sadly disappointed and deserve to be. I bought into some of the hype and pre-ordered it. Its not really that big a deal. The launch games suck. The motion sensor is a joke. Its a little too 'tech' for younger kids to enjoy right out of the box. Its comparable in every way to the XBox 360.

ps3,wii,"Which is Better, Wii or PS3 in terms of name and size and graphics?","Nintendo Wii is small, sleek, fun, fresh and user-friendly. 

Ps3 is a monstrous big heavy machine with a lot of raw power, but sadly that power is used mostly (as gameplay is concerned) exactly in the same way that Ps2 and Ps1. There is nothing new about it. 

Granted, Ps3 graphics are amazing. Is it enough to get me to buy it? Not  really, I'm a grown up now and have better things to do. Though, I'm sure I would enjoy playing someone else's Ps3 for a while. Would I pay that amount of money for it. The answer to that is a categorical NO. 

As for the Wii, it may not have the raw power of Ps3, but it is completely new. It goes back to the basics of gaming: namely, it's quite simply about having tons of fun. It's easy, it's nice and you can get your friends and family and most people will be able to enjoy themselves playing Wii. 

I think Ps3 is an amazing machine, but Nintendo Wii is far better. The Wii has made me want to play videogames again!",i think PS3,"It all depends on what you are looking for in a game console.  If you are purely concerned with power and snazzy graphics, then the PS3 is what you'll most likely be happy with.  If you love games like Mario and Zelda, then the Wii is going to be a great choice for you. Just keep in mind that the Wii costs $249, comes with Wii Sports, and currently doesn't offer DVD playback.  However, it does have wireless capabilities built in, so  you can connect it to your network without cables. The PS3 costs between $500-$600 depending on which model you choose, doesn't come with any games, but includes a built in Blue-Ray DVD player. The better choice is really just a matter of preference....","Wii has a terrible name, you cannot sound cool talking about the wii. As far as graphics, PS3, hands down,size wise, the wii is a lot smaller, which helps. But as far as gameplay, they both innvoated in different ways","wii is a tenfold times better first of all the name kicks major sony ass secondlty its 1/3 of the price third it is a much better gaming experience overall, more intarctive fun stuff wii is smaller and much more compact because of the sony thing the PS3 does have a better overall home media station but not worhty it for the 400 $ snd the wii graphics arnt THAT bad and the PS3 arnt THAT good also xbox360 is a very good comparison and it is definetly also very jclose i think it is mor ein the middle between the two which also make it very good  of the 3 PS3 is worst and i dont know about xbox360 and wii though i am a bit towards the xbox360 just becaus ei play it more with my friends and xboxlive is a lot of fun u made a good choice pickign the wii",PS3 sucks!! because its the same thing as PS2 and 1,I think the ps3 is a little bit better and besides the ps3's controller can lean and have the thing on screen lean too.,"Nintendo Wii is small, sleek, fun, fresh and user-friendly.

ps3,wii,"Which is better overall? xbox360, ps3, and wii.?",None,"I think that each console has it's pros & cons.  For hardcore gamers, I'd stay stick with the tried'n'true PS3 or XBOX 360.  For an all around, good, easy gaming experience, I'd pick the wii.  All in all, it's just a matter of opinion and preference.  For me, they are kinda like pokemon's where I just wanna own 'em all!!!","Games: Right not the 360 has it for the games seeing as PS3 just came out. The games that are out for the PS3 are good and there are more to come so thats a toss up. I guess for the moment 360 has it. Controllers: PS3 easily...I dont like that they took the rumble out BUT they have a really far reaching wireless capability. Also they can be used in games just like the Wii controller i.e moving the controller to act out different movements on the game. The x box controllers suck.  Prices: Ok... The PS3 is expensive but its less than a regular blu-ray disk player and you get more. The X box plays HD-DVDs but the major fall back to that is first off not all titles are coming out on HD-DVD...basically all the good movies will be on Blu-Ray. So the price for the PS3 for what its worth is reasonable. Also you have to think about that fact that it costs Sony $810 to make one console so they're actually losing money to give their customers a decent price. I dont know if it breaks that easily. It broke the same on smashmyps3.com as it did on smashmyxbox.com  Graphics... WELL personally i think the PS3 takes this as well. The only major fall back is that if you dont have a HDTV then you're not getting the full effect and its kind of pointless to buy. I have a HDTV 1080i and it looks amazing. If you have a regular TV than you wont get the same effects. So To be fair i'll give leave it as a tie between PS3 and 360.  ...Other stuff... Its also about personal prefrence. If you have a PS2 with like 42975358 games than a PS3 would be a good investment. You could still play your games (with a lil graphic upgrade =D) and play new games as well. Also with the PS3 you get ONLINE GAMING for free. Unlike the xbox which you have to pay for to use. Personally I think the PS3 is better and I know someone is going to say the 360 is better and thats all well and good. Every one is entitled to their own opinion, and Im sticking to mine. :)",the wii is gonna rock.,"I think the wii is the best because well unlike the xbox 360 , wii took gameplay to the next level.ppl say that ps3 and the 360 have great graphics but who cares at least the wii doesnt have really bad graphics i mean the wii has ok graphics .Who cares if the xbox360 and ps3 can play hd or blue-ray cause if you dont have a hd-tv then you cant play hd-dvd's and this time the nintendo will launch all kinds of games(e/e+10/T and rated m). almost all of the 360's and ps3 games r going to be rated M but they r still going to suck i mean not all of them but most will. the game the 360 will ever have is halo 3 .what so great about the ps3 the only difference is that it play blu-ray more power.What so great with having power when the gameply of the ps3 is going to suck.well let me tell you about the wii(internet,mp3,channel,24connection,chat,play old skool games even the ones from sega and some other things. oh yeah forgot to mention that the ps3 and the 360 overheat if you r playing 4 a long time . well like the the ps3 i may get it in a couple of months just becuase it pays blu-ray well a ps3 is chaeper than a blu-ray player.",for a hard core gamer wii look at it this way you will go bankrupt paying for a ps3 with isn't that good 360 1 good exclusive only good exclusive will be halo 3 other than that splinter cell is for wii to,wii kicks @$$
ps3,wii,What would u prefer a Nintendo Wii or PS3?,"the ps3, because it is less physical. besides it comes with alot more cool options.","Yeah, I want both anyways, but i would preffer a Nintendo Wii too, because Nintendo has different games that PS3 and Xbox360 dont have...","It truely depends on what you are looking for in a video game and what your budget can handle.  The better comparison would be the 360 verse the PS3, in which case I believe the 360 to be the clear winner. The Wii is very good on it's own though, but it's in a different catagory then the PS3 or the 360.","the ps3, because it is less physical. besides it comes with alot more cool options.",Nintendo wii because of low price which means more games. (Hopefully nintendo wii will eventually get games as good as the xbox 360's games),For the price and possibilities I would go for a Wii hands down.,"the PLAYSTATION3 offers the best money can buy,  HIGH DEFINITION any one? 360 come only with a dvd drive,  the HD-DVD is a seperate unit that only plays movies not games,  so 360 isnt a tru next gen system as it wont play high def disks.  the wii, (or why?) is mainy for a younger gamer,  and for gamers that only wnat a game machine,  the PS3 is a mulit-entertainment system ive heard argument up and down all spectrums of fans, PS, 360, wii, PC.  they all have there likes and will disrespect the things that others like.  in the end its up to you, its nice to do research but if you income is limited go with what u want and can get","wii, no doubt. o ya and thanks for answering my ant bully question but it still dusnt help, i tried gamewinners but still nuthing, i've loked everywhere!!!",The Wii Hands Down!!,"The Wii, no contest.",I like the Wii better than the ps3. Always like Nintendo better than the  Playstation.,"Same here.  The Wii looks awesome and has over 330 games available for it.  I cant wait until its in stock again. The PS3 just has the same old same old for games, and doesnt have that many at all.  I couldnt find a single PS3 game that I wanted to play.","Wii, its cheaper - more interactive and Zelda ownz. PS3 is crazy expensive and theres VERY FEW good launch titles.","Me too. It promises something different, instead of just more of the same. Never got into the Playstation anyway."
ps3,wii,Wat system should i get-360? Wii? Ps3?,"PS3

It has better graphics then Wii and 360 and you get more then what the system costs

Blu-ray player ($1000 +)
60 GB Hard drive ( $60.00) (Already over the price of a PS3)

PlayStation 3 ($600)

Plus all that other stuff they have in it I think I read in a article that Sony is loosing more then $800 a unit for what they have it priced for. So I know it seems expensive but it is a bargain.

But good luck getting one","xbox 360 rocks, all the bugs are out of it and it has the best graphics. the ps3 has a better game processor but no games to take advantage of it while the 360 library is getting immense and screw wii","The 360 is the best.  There are many reason; from better games to graphics that are just as good as PS3.  But the biggest advantage is the vast on line gaming community Xbox has.  Playstation will never have the on-line gaming community that Xbox has created.  If you play on line the 360 is your only choice.  If you don't play on line ever, then I guess you could pay more money and settle for a PS3, but why?  Get a 360 and will not be dissapointed.","Xbox 360 costs 300 to 400 dollars PS3 costs 500 to 600 dollars Wii costs 200 dollars The Wii is obviously a better deal. That doesn't mean it is better though. I've heard that ps3 has batter graphics Xbox 360 has great graphics as well as good games. in my opinion, Xbox 360 seems like th way to go Wii maybe, but ps3 is way way too exspensive. Good luck with game buyage dude",ps3 or wii not a 360 they are junk,PS3 It has better graphics then Wii and 360 and you get more then what the system costs Blu-ray player ($1000 +) 60 GB Hard drive ( $60.00) (Already over the price of a PS3) PlayStation 3 ($600) Plus all that other stuff they have in it I think I read in a article that Sony is loosing more then $800 a unit for what they have it priced for. So I know it seems expensive but it is a bargain. But good luck getting one,"get the Wii cheaper and a wider range of games in the long run and as far as graphics go, PS3 has the best, but you should be more concerned about gameplay than graphics","nintendo wii. hecka cool. controlls are kick butt. ps3 is exactly the same as ps2 except it has more memory and if you ask me $600-$700 is REDICULUS for a game system! if you can spend that kind of money, save up and buy something worth while, like a car! a car wont be obsulete in a year. niether will a house, or good credit.","Xbox 360 definately, semi cheap, great graphics, outstanding games. And in some cases multi platform games for the Ps3 and the Xbox 360, xbox 360 version looks and plays better  a great example of this is the game Call Of Duty 3. You wont regret it.",the only system i have not played was the wii.  but i am buying one off ebay hopefully by the end of the week (paycheck :).  but i am hoping for the ps3 around my b-day/Christmas.  at game stop i played the ps3 and the graphics are amazing.  you know in racing games how you normally cant see the people?  well the people even have pimples on their face or just a mask in some cases. even though the x-box 360 has more games the ps3 is light years better. i personally think it is worth the money maby 100 less for both versions but it is still the bomb.  however the wii has the 'funny' factor for it.  i meen who doesn't think that is cool?  if you have the money go for the ps3 if you dont go for the wii.  and only get the xbox 360 if you are a dedicated halo fan because that is all it has going for it against these strong competitors.  hope i helped,"obviously the wii is the best deal because of the price. i was fighting over this topic for weeks and i finally bought an xbox 360. the ps3 is pretty much out of the question. unless you find somewhere where u can actually buy it, they say that sony will be bringin more in early next year. i wanted a wii, but the graphics arent as advanced as its other 2 competitors. i chose the xbox 360 cuz the graphics are amazing and they are the same quality as the ps3's. if ur short on cash, get the wii, if u want quality get the 360, but if u just wanna be fancy, get the ps3","THE 360 BETTER GRAPHICS,MORE FEUTURES THAN ANY CONSOLE ON SALE,AND  IS EVEN BETTER THEN THE PS2 AND Wii THE Wii MORE CHEAP AND I THINK IT CAN PLAY NORMAL NINTENDO GAMES LIKE THE SUPERNINTENDO ONES PS3 $600 BUT U GET MORE FEUTURES THAN THE Wii AND A LITTLE LESS THAN THE 360.AND THIS TIME U CAN USE ANY KIND OF INTERNET NOW FOR LIVE CONECTION.(LIKE XBOX LIVE) SO THE 360 IS THE BEST CHOICE.","first of all ive been doing a lot of research on these 'seventh generation' consoles cus i want one of the for christmas now, here are your choices, that is if u want something worth while either the Xbox 360, PS3, or Wii ok so your first question is graphics now if u have a HDTV then most defenitally the Xbox 360 if not, then both the Xbox 360 and the PS3 are somewhat a challenge but the Wii, well ive heard that its graphics arent as good but that was at the E3 thing and it was only a prototype so therefore im not sure but we can be sure about the Xbox 360 and PS3 so in that case the Xbox should be 'best graphics' because of its 3 3.2ghz processors! vs. the only 1 3.2ghz processor of the PS3 and also the Xbox 360 has 48-way pipliners also the thing i said about th HD thing i just read here in the paper i printed out that Xbox 360 and PS3 both support HD up to 1080p which is one of those big flatscreen things you see ur dad drooling over in circuit city right before football season anyways so yes, Xbox 360 has best graphics i could get down to the nitty gritty but my hands are already tired so best deal would once again be the Xbox 360 because its not too pricey like the PS3 and dose not have a low quality like the Wii (in graphics) so the words 'you get what you pay for' dosent have all the meaning this time for example PS3 = at least $500 ,i think ,also has many bugs (or glitches) which is why when it first came out in Japan it flunked and last but not least what is the best deal well lets review...  Xbox 360           PS3           Wii II                           0               0  i think Xbox 360, thought Wii has its revolutonairy remote control thing which scores a lot of points for me and PS3 has a nice design awsome 'backward' compatability with PS2 along with Wii (it can play all Gamecube games) so again overall i think you should get Xbox 360 for its graphics gigantic memory (which is now removable so u can go over to ur friends house w/o haveing to take the whole thing) and its awsome processors etc...",Wii better games Cheaper,i would say get wii but ive been a nintendo junkie all my life so yeah ps3 is too expensive for me and i just prefer wii over 360 and nothing beats asking your friends to come over to play with your wii
ps3,wii,"What is the better game system PS3,Nintendo Wii,or xbox360??",None,"my friend who works for BEST BUY and got all 3 ! And we play almost exclusively with the Wii!!!! ITS SO FUNNN!!! the 360 hes had for a while so we don't really bother.  oh and the 360's games mainly has games doing 720p.  the ps3 will have much more games using the full 1080p capaablities.  Unfortunately there arent many games for ps3 but it will surpass 360,,, by far.  so here's the verdict:  1>ps3  2>Wii  3>360 BUT get BOTH ps3&Wii,,,,i would pass on the 360",ps3,"The better Game System is the AFFORDABLE one -- the one that lets you stay within the budget based on your income.  For me, I can NOT justify the price of the PS3 (ever!), and the XBox is also more expensive. After reading some of the articles which have game users opinions on them -- and the positives I've seen written on the wii -- that one at $250 (which is STILL an 'OUCH' of a price for what amounts to just another game) is what I deem to be the best game system for the money.",PS3!!! It works out to the same price as the 360 once upgraded to same/equivalent capabilities. Even then it still surpasses the 360. The future(6mths) is in the PS3. Basically choose between PS3 and Wii,"well they can all play games from their previous systems, and i think the ps3 has better graphics, and the 60gb hard drive. and it plays blu ray discs, but costs 600... but if u like to play more interactively, the wii is the best and its only 250.","The 360 is you safest choice if you had to buy a next gen console. It's been out int he market a year longer than the PS3 and the Wii and therefore has many more titals to choose from. Not ot mention it has the strongest online community that's only getting bigger. It's $200 cheaper than the premium package PS3, and lets not forget Halo 3 shipping next year. By the time the PS3 finally gets a great title out (maybe MG4 or Killzone) the Xbox will have already beaten it down."

I do accnowlege the PS3's supperiorness among consoles. The PS3 has superior features and grafix. But I love the story and gameplay of HALO so I will first purchase an XBOX360 upon HALO 3's release because I love HALO. I don't play online because I don't have XBOX live. But I can hold my own in a discution of HALO's history, and story and have many HALO books and action figures and posters. So I think the Microsoft systems rock the hardest because for me, HALO rocks the Hardest.

ps3,wii,Best for 17 year old guy- Wii or ps3?,"The Wii is definitely *NOT* just for kids... it is for all ages.  In fact, there is even a marketing campaign with the AARP toward retired people.

It is really about the games and the play, not the systems themselves.  If your brother has loved Nintendo style games, and especially the DS, I would say that the Wii would be the way to go.  Just get him a Wii Points card and make sure to pick up at least one extra controller.   If everyone I have heard about that has tried it is any indication, chances are you will like it too.

Wii is the console for the gamer and the non-gamer.",i think a wii they come out before ps3 and they're alot cheaper my mates about to get one he agrees and he's almost 17 so go for the wii!!!!,"ur a nice sis, buy the ps3 it is really popular and he'll show it off","just get him a psp...he can download songs, play games and watch movies....it only costs around $200.. oh and he can download pictures","If your brother likes the gameboy and gamecube hes into a different kind of video gaming than other people. Its a very complex thing (as funny as that sounds) and hes kind of side stepped it and gotten what he wants. Yes, it is true the Wii is somewhat geared towards kids, but it is for his age too. If he hates the Xbox 360, he isn't going to like the PS3. Go with the Wii, I'm seventeen years old too (a guy) and its what I'm getting. Its cheaper, has all the games I want. If he likes Nintendo, it means he likes the games that ONLY Nintendo can offer- Mario, Zelda, etc. I recommend getting him the Nintendo Wii along with the Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess. Trust me, its the better bet. Literally, its a lot cheaper too.",probably the wii b/c u get to move around then sit,"well it sounds like you haven't reserved either of them, and at this time its to late to do that, unless u get them off ebay, in which u will pay more than retail price, maybe u can get the wii for $500 on ebay, since the ps3 are getting well over $1,000 right now on ebay.","I would go for ps3 because your brother is 17 and I'm not saying Nintendo is for kids, but you know ps3 has better gun games.. etc. wii is suppose to cost $250 and you can get 20 gb ps3 for $499,99 http://www.sonystyle.com/is-bin/INTERSHOP.enfinity/eCS/Store/en/-/USD/SY_BrowseCatalog-Start?CategoryName=tvvideo_hav_ps3&Dept=tvvideo http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?id=pcmcat91400050028&type=category http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?navLevel=4&type=category&navHistory=cat00000%2Bcat02000%2Bcat02119&id=pcmcat91400050030 here's some of the information on the consoles Ps3 also has blue ray built in which is really great for watching dvds.

I went to Florida and had the chance to play the Playstation 3. The graphics were not that much better than the 360, maybe 5-10% better. Anyways, the Playstation 3 will run you 400-600 dollars depending on the size of the harddrive you decide to go with. The Nintendo Wii however (which is releasing tonight at midnight) has a launch price of 250 dollars. Since he has a nintendo DS, go with the Wii. The Wii introduces revolutionary gameplay with it's motion sensory controllers and in-depth interactive gameplay. I am a hardcore gamer and own a 360, DS, and PS2, and tonight at midnight a Nintendo Wii. Do him a favor...get him a Wii!","The Wii is definitely *NOT* just for kids... it is for all ages.

I don't recommend he views DVD+/-R/Ws with the PS3. This will age the system faster than normal (as the system will work harder to read the different formats). So if he has burned DVDs, don't let him use the PS3.","Well, being a nintendo fan myself I would say go with the nintendo wii.  As you have mentioned the ps3 is far more expensive and it will also be extremely hard to get your hands on one before x-mas.  No, the games are not for little kids, but nintendo does make games for them as well.  If your brother didn't like the xbox 360 then I would think he is not into the sports games.  'Just a guess'  The games for nintendo are more adventerous, the games for ps3 are more action, sports, and some adventure.  So there you have it.  Best of luck!  And you can do a quick search to see the features of each, and compare to which system you think would be most compatible for him. If it helps any, i'm 18.","Good luck trying to get a PS3.  From what I understand, only 400,000 worldwide will be produced.  If you were to try to get one, you would probably be trample!.  Watch CNN to see what happened today.  These folks are crazy!",THE PS3
ps3,wii,What is hotter right now Ps3 or Wii?,"I would say PS3 b/c of the graphics for one, plus you get more w/ the PS3 since it is able to play HD-DVDs and also it is able to play blue-ray disc, also the controllers are wireless this time for PS3, with the Wii the graphics to me ate all right but w/ their controller it will take you a min to get use to the controllers and how to use the controls unlike PS3 its like all the other regular PS controller","i like both but i think in the long run Nintendo may win this round.  I say this because their controllers are amazing, and all of their games are still $49.99 to where as Sony and XBox are 59.99, and for the price of a Sony with the big memory will cost 600 to where wii is only 250 and the memory chips are only 100??  I think wii will win the Christmas push also because they will have over 5 million units compared to Sony's 400,000 hitting the shelves?  So in all Nintendo has risen from the ashes and finally made something that competes with the rest of the competition.","Depends, people who want awesome graphics and well known games(RPGs/Fighters)..the PS3 is preferred.   If you're not rediculously rich, the Wii is less than 1/2 the price and Nintendos' games seem to be much more fun and they should have more consoles in stock than the harder to manufacture PS3...plus they have Zelda.","I have a Wii and I think it is amazing.  It took me no time to get used to the remote (Wii-mote).  When playing Need for Speed Carbon, you just turn the Wii-mote like it's the steering wheel.  You really get into the game.  For Madden '07, you attach the nunchuck to the Wii-mote and use them to do everything. Thrust forward to tackle, hold one out to block, etc.   As far as PS3 having an integrated Blu-Ray disc player... poor design.  This is where the PS3 falls behind the x-Box 360.  The fact that it's integrated screws you over if it should ever fail.  With the x-Box's separate HD-DVD player, if it fails you send it for repair and play games while you wait.  You lose your PS3 for the time of repair if the Blu-Ray goes out. PS3 definately has some impressive selling points.  But really, it all depends on what's more important for you.  100 kids aged 8-18 played both the Wii and the PS3.  An overwhelming amount (over 90%) said that the PS3 had superior graphics.  However, 3/4 chose the Wii over the PS3 for playability, which was considered more important by most. The PS3 plays many PS1 and PS2 games, and the Wii plays many games from it's former systems.  Consider the games that Nintendo typically releases compared to PS3.  Usually more for children, but also consider that many of the games being released on x-Box 360 and PS3 are also being released on Wii... and typically for a few dollars less.","Personally i think that the Wii will go far during this time.  Ps3 is insanely priced and i've heard some ppl are having problems with it.  And yes the Wii has been having issues too, but it's so interactive.  you can play baseball, tennis...you have Zelda on it too.  i have a Wii and it's fun.  you get a few of your friends and you have a bowling league!  The graphics arent' the greatest but nintendo will sooner or later catch up with Sony or xBox.  But it's Nintendo.  We all grew up with it.",I think that the Ps3's may be hotter because they have such a ps fan boy club goin on.  I think the better system is the Wii.  Both of the xbox360 and ps3 are having troubles.  The Wii-mote is amazing.  Very accurate and I havent had any problems with things in my house bothering the connection between the remote and console.  Unless your standing behind a wall.  And the dvd player idea..You can save the $400 more you would have spent on the Wii and buy yourself a $40 dvd player that has decent features on it.  In the end..The Wii tried something new with the controller and succeeded and the Ps3 did a crappy job in a rush to compete with the Wii..and failed..but becasue of the ps fanclub and limited supply of consoles..I think the ps3 is hotter..,ps3 because it less than the Wii,"The PS3 is the hotter game, which is why there are none available right now.   There are still Nintendo Wii's on store shelves.    I think Nintendo screwed up when they didn't put the DVD player on the system.",Ps3 is for teenagers and older and Wii is for kids.,"the Wii is so bad, i have a friend that has it and u have to completely clear the room of everything or else the game will pick it up","I would say PS3 b/c of the graphics for one, plus you get more w/ the PS3 since it is able to play HD-DVDs and also it is able to play blue-ray disc, also the controllers are wireless this time for PS3, with the Wii the graphics to me ate all right but w/ their controller it will take you a min to get use to the controllers and how to use the controls unlike PS3 its like all the other regular PS controller","Wii is definitely better, people are just buying PlayStation 3 just to sell it on eBay for desperate people. Check this website, you can see Wii sold a lot more than PlayStation 3's. www.nexgenwars.com","hard to tell. the reputation of the ps1 and 2 are appealing to customers, not to mention the graphics. but people are put off by price, and thats where wii comes in its price is low so it will appeal to a lot of people. personally i think wii is better. its not the next generation, its the new generation of gaming. its unique game experience adds so much more fun"
ps3,wii,which one is better a ps3 or a nintendo wii?,"tom just said what i was going to ,,,, whoo hoo tom","The ps3.  The only thing the wii has going for it is the new type user interface, this novelty will become old when games are ultimately more difficult to control causing them not to be played for very long.  Add the fact that the wii only supports 480i, does not support digital surround sound and does not play dvds; and you can see a real possibility of getting bored quickly with this unit.  But you never know, Nintendo might produce enough software to make the wii worth keeping.  Only Time will tell. The PS3 on the other hand is a very powerful machine capable of playing high def games up to 1080p, supports digital surround sound, plays dvds, and is capable of surfing the Internet.  You can even upgrade the hard drive yourself to any 2.5 inch (laptop) SATA hard drive.  If 60 GB of space is not enough, install a 120 gb or 200gb hard drive.  The online gaming is also free and you can connect using WiFI if you buy the 60gb model. The PS3 and Wii are in totally different classes and you cannot really even compare them to each other.","For younger kids, I strongly suggest the Wii. If it is for a teenager or adult, definitely the PS3.","i think nintendo wii, but you should really look it up, to see which is the best for you.","Nintendo Wii, for kids OR adults. Especially adults with taste. Don't be suckered into buying a PS3 just cos it has 'playstation' written on the side of it.","tom just said what i was going to ,,,, whoo hoo tom","little kids Wii, teens to adults PS3 rules all! PS3 has wireless bluetooth controllers on both models, the controllers are motion sensitive (Sixaxis) like the Wiimote, wi-fi connection on the 60GB HDD model, oh did I mention both models have HDD's (one is a 20GB and the other is a 60GB), Cell Broadband Engine ( the chip running it has 8 cores!), blu-ray, will connect to the internet and let you browse. Has a butt load of USB ports to load pics,movies and plug in a mouse or keyboard. Oh and it can run Linux Distros or a PPC compatible OS. And it comes standard with the XMB. Wii is a Game Cube with a new controller, PS3 is the next generation of Gaming. But if you're a Nintendo Fanboy you wouldn't know about Next gen cuz you'll just settle for mediocre products. P.S.

ps3,wii,What is the best System? 360 Wii or PS3?,u should get a 360 and a wii because the PS3 is just a more expensive version of a 360. if u only get a wii it wont feel right playing games like call of duty and madden and nba live so thats why im getting both for my b-day,"Wii all the way, SONY is losing abotu 200 dollars on each model they sell, and the 360 has already been one-upped.",The Wii! Zelda has to be the best game ever. A must play for all.,"Well i think all three systems are great. Xbox 360 with Gears of War and Xbox live. The Wii with The Legend Of Zelda, Twilight Princess, and the cool looking remote. And PS3 with all the great feature but the extremely expansive price tag is a big no, no for me. so ill say The Wii All the way with the free Internet Access 24/7 feature and plus ill be able to download all my favorite games from the NES up to the  Gamecube for about $5-$10 bucks, =p","It has to be the Wii, its the only one that has tried to bring us something new for a reasonable amount of money while keeping it simple to use at the same time. the PS3 is ridiculously expensive because Sony is trying to force blueray and the 360 is also expensive not only because of the system but also because many extras which should already be included arent - both the 360 and the PS3 are most likely to have errors which decrease player satisfaction. I was a staunch PS3 fan until i realised i'd probably get better value for money with the Wii because lets not forget buying the system isn't the only thing that matters - you also have to be able to afford games but with the Wii that's less of an issue seeing as there are five inbuilt games that are bundled along with it. If graphics are the thing that matters to you most then go with the PS3/360","That's really a personal preffrence thing. I prefer the Wii, since I could care less about graphics, the only reason I even own a PS2 is because of all the games that aren't avalible on the GC. That's a pretty massive factor, there. In terms of the industry, I think the Wii will catch up to the 360 and pull ahead of their market share over the next year. The PS3 will appear to be way behind at year end, but will have restored their dominance by the end of the first fiscal quarter. Nintendo will have a much larger market share than it did with the GC, Sony will shrink slightly but still hold a commanding lead. XBox will be lucky to survive through to the next next gen.","the wii because it is cheap, zelda and the other games look good, and it is meant to be played by a wider range of people",u should get a 360 and a wii because the PS3 is just a more expensive version of a 360. if u only get a wii it wont feel right playing games like call of duty and madden and nba live so thats why im getting both for my b-day,PS3 forsure,i dont know probably 360 Wii,"In all honestly if you have HD, PS3. it's expensive but if you frequently play video games and want the best picture and game play and already have and HD then PS3 is your best bet. Although the if you aren't much of a gamer and have the HD then the 360 will suffice and the Nintendo Wii is more for those who enjoy the classics, plus you don't need a fancy hi def TV for it to be at it's best.","PS3:  more 3rd party support, more fanboys, it embraces the future.  With each console, Sony is thinking ahead:  PSX - CD instead of cartridges, PS2 - DVD instead of CD/GD-ROM/Cartridge, PS3 - Blu-Ray instead of DVD-9 and Optical Disks.","Wii all the way, PS3 is cool but has nothin really new, and xbox 36o, is okay,but wii is awesome, there just jealous, the old school gamers who had and played the old school games not the noobs who think they are gamers, graphics does not make a game, PS3 is for fatties if your a couch potato. wii is for sexy people, who will get married and have a sexy bod...so fatties or sexy bod... wii hands down,"
ps3,wii,Is the Wii better than the PS3?,"Those two consoles are really hard to compare saying that they take one idea and distribute them differently.

I think it's early to call the shots since PS3 has been just released and wii is not even released yet but in general Wii is supposed to change the way you play games. So far the reviews of the new wiimote sounds pretty promising but whether it will live up to expectations or not is yet to be seen...",My 14-year-old says that there is less chance of getting arthritis from the Wii remote because there are fewer buttons and there are more arm movements.  I guess you get exercise that way.... Your mileage may vary.,The PS3 is better because of the integration with the PSP and the sweet processing power behind it.,"I've played both I can honestly say that the Wii is more fun.  Ps3 is just like ps2 with better graphics.  Wii is good, and it will not lack more mature titles (see red steel)","I think PS3 will be way better. Most people agree the technology is cutting-edge for all three big name systems (including Xbox 360). It all comes down to what games are available for each, and history shows that Sony has had the largest selection of games. PS3 and Xbox 360 caters to more adult audiences, while Nintendo to a much younger crowd... although there may be some one-shot hits that cause people to buy a system. Like for me, I bought Gamecube just for Metroid Prime. Then Resident Evil 4 was released as bonus (these are two of the greatest games of all time).. but once i beat them, i sold the Cube on ebay. About the wiimote, didn't nintendo come with something similar back in the day.. called the power glove? that turned out to be a flop."
ps3,wii,"I would like to know, should i buy the PS3 or the Wii?",None,"The Wii, because the Playstation systems have been known to break down in mid gameplay. Rumor is that the Xbox 360 and PS3 are going to have games that you can't play on your friend's game system; however, Nintendo Wii games will be playable on your friend's Wii.","The Wii is definently the system everyone wants to buy, $600 for the PS3 is way too much, Wii is only $250. you can buy 2 Wii systems and 2 games for the price of one PS3 with no game. Or buy one Wii and 7 games for the price of one PS3 with NO games. Wii comes with a game.  PS3 does not. Wii Remote is innovative. PS3 remote is unchanged since 1995, plus it doesn't even have rumble.  Also PS2 controllers won't work with PS3 unless....you spend more money (see a theme yet?) and get an adaptor Blu-ray is unproven, it might lose the format war to HD-DVD.  Its expensive, and hard to develop games on, and that makes games on the PS3 expensive ($70-120).  Also, there is only a handful of Blu-ray movies even available, good luck finding anything in Blockbuster. Wii is tiny, like 3 DVD cases stacked together.  The PS3 is huge, VCR huge. Wii has a free browser that lets you browse the internet from your TV if you have a wireless network at home. Wii will play Wii discs, Gamecube discs and will have a potential library of nearly every game ever made through its Virtual Console feature.  Systems such as NES, SNES, Sega Genesis, N64, TurboGrafix 16, among others are already available.  Systems such as Atari Jaguar, Sega Saturn and the Dreamcast are rumored to be in the works.  If you buy a Wii, you will have virtually ever system ever made at your fingertips.  If you get a PS3, you will have only Sony consoles that are playable. In short, don't believe the BS hype Sony is trying to pull.  Everyone wants a Wii, and rightfully so.  Its the better system.

Dispite the fact that the PS3 is more expensive, if you're looking for a true 'video game' system you can't buy the Wii.  If you look at the history of these two companies since the release of the original Playstation you'll see what I mean.  The first year the PS1 came out Nintendo took a huge hit and the Nintendo 64 was ok, but a failure compaired to the success of Sony's new system.  Then the PS2 came out and is possibly still the best video game system out there.  Coupled with the release of Microsoft's Xbox the Nintendo Game Cube flopped.  So, as you see, the Nintendo Wii is doomed to fail with the spectacular performance of the Xbox 360 and the much anticipated release of the PS3."

The only valid argument against the Wii I've heard yet is that the graphics aren't specfreakintacular. If graphics are deal-breaker for you, don't bother. The Wii is being marketed for everyone, not exclusively children and the elderly. Point me towards the Grannies playing Red Steel or the toodler playing Call of Duty 3. Simply for not completely excluding entire demographics, it gets called a kid's system. It doesn't give you a workout and the Surgeon General isn't about to start recomending everyone buy a Wii instead of doing step arobics. All it takes to generate actions is a flick of your wrist. I've said it before and it deserves to be said again. If you can't manage that, you've got bigger problems than which system you should pick up. Now, I haven't called anyone out on the fact that XBox players are all ADHD kids who stood in the same place for more than ten minutes, for the first time since birth, when the 360 was released because they think a $300 system is totally worth it to play Halo 3. I didn't say anything about Sony fans being the unfortunate result of a society that believes that if no one is being killed, nothing's happening and that the PS3 is really just another example of all the Special Effects in the world to draw you away from it's morbidly over-used themes and content so preditable you could set a clock by it. I haven't said these things up until now. Why? Because they're unfair generalizations that by no means apply to either of these groups of people, if anyone at all. If I can express myself without calling anyone that disagrees with me children, surely you all can too. So knock-it off. If you can think of something logical to say, great. I love information. But all this 'kiddy' system and 'too much effort' crap is getting real old and I'm pretty fed up with every completely substanceless argument being parroted over and over by people that can't think for themselves. This is not an attack on anyone who posted, just something I'm tired of hearing about. Now, to answer the question. If you have a PS2, like it, and have the cash get a PS3. I'm sure it's exactly what you're looking for. The Wii is nothing like your PS2, so if that's the experince you're looking for, the Wii would be a total waste of money. Infact, it's a straight one or the other sort of thing, get the PS3. Unless you're really unsatisfied with your PS2, you probably won't like the Wii as much as you'll like the PS3.

Right now, the PS3 doesn't have a lot of good games becuase developers are still getting used to blu-ray. In about a year the PS3 will most likely be the best system of the 3. But if you want whichever is better currently, I'd go with Wii.",I would suggest waiting for a few months.  Every game system has kinks that need to be worked out when they first become available to buy.  Save yourself the headaches and wait until the hype has calmed down and the kinks have been resolved.,"Wii cause it's unique and easy, also the PS3 it too expensive and still has defects.  I have the PS2 also, and I want the Wii.  PS3 is kind of the same but not really also.  I'd rather spend money on something that doesn't have defects."
ps3,wii,"Which should I buy xbox 360, PS3 or Nintendo WII?","It all comes down to the type of games that you like.

Xbox 360 is good for multiplayer games, and their games are geared towards a more mature audience.

PS3, if the PS and PS2 are any indication, will be good with strategy, rpg and other one-player type games.  Sony has had the widest library of games for their systems since the original PS.  (My pick)

The Wii on the other hand, will have very entertaining and innovative games.  If you like the Nintendo DS, you'll love the Wii.","It all comes down to the type of games that you like.

ps3,wii,What should I get a Ps3 or wii?,Go for the Wii. Most of the PS3 titles are sports and the same type of games only with better graphics. Wii will change the way you play.

ps3,wii,Which is better the Nintendo Wii or the PS3????,"wii without a doubt!!!!!!!!!!

POWER TO NINTENDO!!!!!!!!!!!","The wii will definately need some ''getting used to'' because of its unique controller design. Im waiting for awhile, before i decide on either system. Let them get the kinks out, and see what user ratings are after the few months. PS2 has so many titles out, that im gonna continue to play that for awhile......who needs the best system right away. If you wait, the prices go down, and the best system will reveal itself with consumers.","In my opinion, Wii. I would rather play Zelda than anything on Playstation. Also, if you want something new, not just more technology, go with the Wii.",Maybe both!!!,"it really depends on what you're looking for. right now the ps3 doesn't have any game worth spending 600 dollars on, and the wii has Zelda and Red Steel. the PS3 has more potential overall, but it will be about a year before the really heavy hitters come out ( GTA 4, Metal Gear Solid 4, Final Fantasy whatever, Gran Turismo, etc.)  the wii is the flavor of the month, and although it has some really fun games like Rayman and Zelda, it's up to the developers to take advantage of the technology.  The big games coming up for the wii are Metroid Prime: Corruption Super Mario Galaxy and WarioWare:smooth moves.  If you like old school games, the wii wins hands down with downloadable NES, Super NIntendo and N64 games.  I'd say buy a wii if you have a xbox 360, and wait on the ps3.",wii without a doubt!!!!!!!!!! POWER TO NINTENDO!!!!!!!!!!!,"The PS3 is better technology, but the Wii is cheaper.

ps3,wii,PS3 - Wii - Xbox360?----Best one----?,"It's hard to say which system is better than the other, considering that two of the group (PS3 and Wii) haven't had their debut yet.  However, I still stick to my belief that the best system available does depend on the eye of the beholder, or more specifically the purchaser.  The PS3 is the most powerful system on the market, with its Blueray technology, making the graphics engine more powerful and disc memory greater, however, the price tag for the PS3 IS steep but rightly so.  Also, sadly what the people mentioned above is also true, the fact that certain people will buy multiple game systems (which sucks since only 400,000 will be shipped to the U.S. this 19th) and double the price on Ebay.  However, if you truly desire the PS3, paying that high cost or just waiting a few months shouldn't be too much of a hassle.  In contrast, the Wii is technologically the weakest system on the market when looking at statistics, however it makes up for this with its new, innovative way of gaming.  Not only is the price tag for the Wii inexpensive ($250 for the system and only $50 for the games) but the chance of you getting one is greater when, as stated in Game Pro magazine, there is going to be 1,000,000 units shipped to the U.S on the Nov. 19th.  Also, with an online service from the start that allows you to download classic Nintendo games from previous systems for $5 -$10 and another, alternative control available if you don't desire the new Wii remote and Nunchuk (Even though Game Pro magazine tested the controller with Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess and said it worked flawlessly), the Wii is a haven for any Nintendo fan and a strong option for any gamer.  Finally, the Xbox 360 is moderately priced for its capabilities and is reliable for its spectacular online capabilities.  Also, with games like Ninja Gaiden Sigma and Halo 3 (Which the staff at Electronic Gaming Monthly have already demoed, even though it won't be avaible until late 2007), the Xbox 360 is sure to be a system that won't let down.

    As stated before, I believe that the system you desire is all in your preference, because none of these gaming companies should be going anywhere anytime soon.  Also, regarding the waiting several months to get the systems, I believe that all gamers understand me when I say there is no feeling like getting the latest gaming system and games as quickly as possible.  Now, don't misunderstand me, it IS VERY wise to wait to pick up your newest game system after the price has dropped and the bugs have been worked out but I believe you meet the same goal by buying a warranty with your new system upon purchase.  That way if the system scrambles, you can just trade it in for a new one.  Just remember, when shopping for the latest game system, I don't believe its not a matter of what is best but what you like, especially considering that all of the game systems have something to offer.  For example, I'm mostly a Nintendo fan, but I like the works of Microsoft and Sony as well.  So, I'm going to start off buying a Wii, which is the cheapest from the start, then I'm going to wait until prices drop and pick up a PS3 and an Xbox 360.  What will you do?  I leave that up to you.

A month from now, maybe two this will be a great question. I can tell you from my experience why I say this. I heard everyone talk about how the 360 was going to change everything. i already owned 2 xbox, 110 games, 2 ps2's 68 games and every older system made (almost) and at least 10 games. I've been collecting for a long time now. Anyhow, I took the plung and bought one off of those 'people'(nazi's) on emaby. I had it three weeks before I had to send it back. the second one lasted two months, sent it back. Now on my third I'm getting ready to send it back. is the 360 a great machine? hell yes...when it works.  No one can tell you yet if the PS3 or the WII is going to be durable. and why spend 250/600 for something that is going to break down all the time.  Lastly, Some jerk will go into your local walmart and buy 20 of each. then he will sit on Ebay and create a market for these machines. Now a PS3 that would have cost you 600 is now going to be 1500 all so some jerk can turn a couple of bucks at your expense. Thank Ebay for letting this happen and rape all of us long itme gamers out of a fair shake. anyhow, wait at least 6 months to buy either one of those units, you'll be happy you did.",wii its cheaper motion sensor and the legend of zelda oh and u can play classic games.,"It's all about the games. Alot of people prefer Nintendo games because they're simply fun to play. But, no online yet? C'mon Nintendo..time to get with the times. The PS3 is going to be a technical behemoth by the sound of it, but unless it's got the games you want, it'll have a hard time justifying the price tag. The 360 has some pretty established games already (Halo series, Gears of War now are enough to carry a system) and it technically has enough power to satisfy any gamer; also a more reasonable price tag than the PS3...however, there's been lots of complaints about the damn thing breaking down...something to keep in mind. Either way, I always think it's best to wait until the initial market frenzy has settled down and the first generation of machines have been sold. Normally after that point, the majority of bugs will be worked out of the system and the games will have caught up with the technology once developers have had a chance to really get into the hardware.",if you are willing to pay the price a ps3 would be the choice but if you dont only a xbox 360 will do,I think the Xbox 360 and the Wii are the ones to get because they both like they have good graphics and kool controllers the PS3 just sucks and its way to much for crap.,i know that ps3 is better because ps2 was better than the xbox which sucks ass so try the ps3 i think you'll like the results,"I'm not a serious gamer, but the XBox 360 seems to be the one to get.  It's got a lot of features & controls that are easy to get used to & at a cheap price also.","when it comes to hardware and raw computing power, ps3 is the best. all the new features that make so expensive also gives it tons of potential for some truly awesome games.","Well, i would know more than everyone here because i have had first hand experience with all 3 systems, and to tell you the truth, the winner is the Wii. The graphics are top-notch for the system specs, is almost completely portable, and has the most innovation than the other systems combined. Classics like Super Smash Bros., LOZ, Metroid, and soooooooooooooooooooo many many many more. Second is the Ps3 only because of The series it has, and the 360 just stinks. It has toooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo many problems.","I believe that the best one is the XBox 360 because it offers everything that the PS3 offers for a lower price, and the Wii has terrible graphics and the new controls aren't extremely impressive",ps3 any day,The best console depend on the games u favor. not the wii cause the games are silly and childish.
ps3,wii,Xbox306 vs. Sony PS3 vs. Nintendo Wii...Battle Royale! Who will come out on top and why?,"as a completely neutral observer i think microsoft released the 360 too early. it could have taken its time a little and refined its design and STILL have brought it out at least 6 months or more earlier than either sony or nintendo. as a result the 360s are all overheating and half the world is suing microsoft for it. the ps3 certainly looks promising especially with its Cell processor which is based on a very different and unique(many would say revolutionary) design from ordinary microprocessors. although it has already been released its too early to say whether it will be popular or not however i heard that already used ps3s are appearing for sale in japan which is very interesting we'll just have to wait and see if (and why) this is. the nintendo wii, like the ps3 has some revoulutionary features however while the ps3's are more of the under the hood type the wii's are all on the outside. the first and most obvious is the way u play with it. nintendo has always had a way of bringing out innovative designs and concepts. a couple of years ago they released the nintendo DS and with this system theyre also introducing something totally new, this time its a controller with motion sensors that u just move around to play. for example in a sword fighting game when u want the character to swing the sword, u just swing the controller instead of pressing a button. of course if this catches on it will pretty much revolutionize the game industry however i think nintendo's got an uphill battle ahead of them, because most developers will find it very complicated and time consuming (and therefore more expensive) programming thier games to respond to different controller movements. this could result in most companies simply leaving the wii and developing their games for the xbox360 or ps3 instead resulting in goodbye nintendo.another problem with the wii is the name itself, in my opinion the name is just stupid take for example the fact that it DOESNT EVEN MAKE SENSE. another thing i dont like is that these past few years nintendo's been trying to appeal more and more to young kids in my opinion theyve got to get their act together before they lose more and more market share and eventually just go out of business like sega. theyve made a lot of missteps these past few years (like the game boy micro, which has no improvements over the GBA SP and in a lot of ways is actually worse) but if they do everything right in the next few years then they should be back on even ground with sony and microsoft, otherwise...","as a

The original Xbox was released after the PS2 during the last generation console wars and contained superior hardware.  It flopped terribly in Japan (just like the 360 is doing in Japan) and thus did not receive as many licensing agreements for games, because let's face it, the majority of the game software development is still done by Japanese firms. Based on the past support the PlayStation has had for both the PS1 and PS2, I think the PS3 will come out on top simply because it will have a larger game library available.  All the extras like Blu Ray and such are just bonuses to real gamers.  Blu Ray or not, gamers are going to purchase the system with the most games they want, and that will most likely be the PS3","X-Box 360 may be an awesome gaming system, but you have to face it; the system that is relesed LAST will probably be the best, simply because they've had a chance to look at the competition."

But currently the Wii is selling like mad, and those are people actually buying to PLAY the console... Not sell it on Ebay..

PS3 is having some manufacturing problems and I doubt that they will sell at least over 1 million by the end of the summer.. Like 80% of the people buying it are buying it to sell on Ebay because of the gaintic profit...

From what Microsoft said, they have sold so far at least 9million Xbox360s WORLDWIDE.

But so far here is the update..
http://www.nexgenwars.com",The 360 has defenatly sold the most so far because it has been out the longest.  Which ones are selling the fastest is unknown to me thought.,i think the will and 360 is selling the most.,"i believe the ps3 down the line will sell the most because of sonys good quality gaming. as of now i believe the 360's have sold more units, but the ps3's are selling at ridiculous prices moneywise for christmas. The Wii might sell more now, but not as much as the ps3 or 360 i believe.",360 has sold the most since its been out the longest when Sony ships a load of ps3 the will over last and everyone who wanted one has one ps3 might take the win....kinda like when it was ps2 xbox and gamecube i believe the orders that sold the most where ps2 then xbox then gamecube probably gonna be ps3 360 and wii,"Sort of hard to answer, because of how you phrased it. The 360 has sold the most and will still have sold the most at the end of the year. No one has enough production to top 7 Million. On the basis of # of units sold per day, probably Nintendo. 360's sales are strong, as well but I'd give Nintendo the edge, here. They would sell way more PS3's if they were there to be bought, but they're not so Sony is in a distant last place there. When everything's said and done by the end of 2007 there will probably be more PS3's purchased.","360 just reached the 7 million mark, so its the leader, but its been on the shelf since last nov. the wii and ps3 just came out and are selling out. PS3 had some supply problems so they havent got as many to the stores as they wanted, but demand is there. Wii is planning 4 million consoles in america by the year end, if they keep flying off the shelf they will be the #2 behind the 360 in terms of sales. Considering the long lines waiting to buy a PS3, they will do well once they get the supply in the stores.  Most stores are only getting 3-10 per week compared with the dozens of boxes of Wiis.","SHAME ON SONY FOR RELEASING LIMITED NUMBER OF PS3s TO INCREASE DEMAND AND VALUE.

The ps3 and it's super gay prices has got to go(at least until it's price drops and they get better games).               The wii controller idea is pretty good,but I only want Zelda from this system. It needs better graphics then what I've seen.            So get the 360 and buy the right system the first time.","Wii because it is more cheaper than the PS3 and the 360. Besides, it has some cool games I want to buy.","First of all, there is no way that 360's graphics are better than ps3's. I was playing it today and it blew me away how much better the graphics were. I mean i didn't think they could get that much better. But they have. So im going to say PS3 all the way.","If you dont have an HDTV or alot of money, but the wii, if you do have a little bit of money, Buy the 360, i'm a microsoft fan all the way, it's super fun, good online gaming, has had more gamespot 'Game of the year' Titles on Xbox than PS2, and probley still will, also if you like Halo, Halo 3 is coming next year, so is the awesome Gears of War and other awesome titles 'Only for Xbox.' It crashes alot if played for lengths at a time, about 6 hours, if you buy one, you should only play for about 6 hours, let it cool for about 1 hour, then you can play again with no worry. Thats why i think you should get the 360 over the PS3 (Wii optional if not alot of cash)","I would say Nintendo Wii. It's on my Christmas list. The PS3 is WAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYY TOO OVERPRICED!!! You are right about that. On the Xbox 360, there are many glitches in the games. The Wii is affordable, has great games, and who cares if you don't have HDTV? Neither do I. I also think the Wii's controller is great. You don't just sit there like a lazy idiot, you get up and move around, due to the motion sensors. I think that the Wii is the way to go.",ps3,"Personally, i would prefer Ps3 Reasons: 1) Best tech specs in the 3 options (except when its core system is compared with 360) 2) Wide variety of games 3) Games are usually of higher standard as compared to other current brands (from experience) However: 1) Its controller seems damn uncomfortable to be held........... 2) V.expensive.................. 3) Design not as attractive, as under comparison to 360"
ps3,wii,which is better the nintendo wii or the sony ps3?,"nintendo wii. i work at best buy, and no wii's have been returned, but tons of ps3 owners have come back complaining that their ps3's aren't working.

the wii is also more fun to play. it's more interactive. it works better and faster, too.",PS3 is better because you could only play the wii for a short amount of time before your arms started to go numb,"You're just going to get opinions wit that question but i can give you a good answer. Neither is 'better' than the other. Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft all have their 'ocean' of fans so different people are going to say one's better than the other whether they've always had Playstations, always bought Nintendo products, or whatever. Most people would say PS3 just cuz it's more powerful. If i had the money right now i'd get the PS3 or even both but i'd say the 360 is better than both because it's got the head start, the most games, and almost a year to fix any problems with the system. You'll have to wait a few months to see how well the PS3 or the Wii does so that question can't really be answered right now.","Nintendo has gone in a different direction and have left graphics at the door and have pushed forward with Innovation. The controller is truly amazing and is quick to get use to. You can't even play DVDs on the Wii as originally thought you could. The main reason to stick with Nintendo is for their amazing first party games: Zelda, Mario, Metroid, Smash, among others. If the first party games do not appeal to you, maybe Wii is not for you. PS3 has gone with graphics and it shows. The games I have seen look amazing. Unfortunately the price tag is too much for me to ever even think about. If it dropped to $300 I would consider it. The inclusion of Blue Ray could not be considered that great, as I don't think the technology is that much different to even take off. The games will start pouring in mid next year to the end of next year, with the typical exclusives that we are use to on their previous system. Will Playstation continue its reign as the top system? It is looking like it might, but Nintendo will take some of its previous control away (maybe even the 360).",nintendo wii is better because it don't need a fan and can't over heat.,"i guess it depends...playstations are known to carry the bulk of games with them, but there are not many for the ps3. If you are graphics crazy and love the best of everything get a ps3. However, if you are looking to spend less and want a game system with less special features and a bit stripped down graphics get a wii. If you have the money though i would suggest a ps3 as it is going to have the new final fantasy on it along with a new line of games. Perhaps if you buy the wii, then if you see the ps3 you might desire it, but if you have the ps3 there is nothing to desire as it is top of the line!",This is coming from a mom that never gets to pay video games with out my child having a breakdown in laughter.  The Wii is awesome.  I liked it number one because it came with Wii Sports.  I did not have to drop 60.00 to get a game before we could play.  My neighbor camped out for 4 days for a Playstation 3 and it is back at the store already.  It crashed and the game is still inside it!  This Wii has been flawless.  I think that Nintendo has done a much better job of offering up a stable platform for play!,"nintendo wii. i work at best buy, and no wii's have been returned, but tons of ps3 owners have come back complaining that their ps3's aren't working. the wii is also more fun to play. it's more interactive. it works better and faster, too."

I can get them both for the price of a PS3, and the only games I'll be missing out on are Final Fantasy and Metal Gear.

Wii or X-360 or PS3 also VOTE!!! the most votes the more you See?,The Nintendo WII  by far!,wii,The Nintendo WII  by far!,"i like the wii while it dosnt have as much horsepower or as good graphics as the 360 or the ps3 it is different, video games have stayed the same since there release with just the graphics changing the wii is a true next generation machine",The Wii. Its the next generation of consoles and It has the fastest loading times because it does not have a hard drive. It does not need a hard drive because its 512 MB of flash memory could hold uop to 1000 games. Thats more than enough.,"Wii; it can play ANY Nintendo game ever made.  It can also play some SEGA Dreamcast games, as well as CDs and DVDs.  However, I don't usually play video games, and it's kind of expensive for someone on a tight budget, so I don't plan on buying one anytime in the near future.  Have fun!  P.S. If you are going to buy the Wii tomorrow, I suggest you go camp out today at Best Buy, EB Games, etc. to guarantee you getting one.",Wii,"Xbox 360 is the best, who cares about ps3 cell processor, blu ray. Xbox has halo. and any way the games on both are virtually the same in every way. I used to be a playstation fan but since theres barely any difference i pick which one has the best games","PS3, people were going crazy in line.  With all the shooting people and jumping people just to get one.",i like PS3 and i dont care how much it freezes up!! I always Prefer PS3  and i think that it freezes up is a rumor made by Nintendo Makers so people can go buy there game rather than PS3!! hAtErS,PS3,"Going by Games, 360 because its been out longest. Going by power, PS3 it has a sweet cell processor. Going by innovation, i like Wii.

ps3,wii,With $900 should I buy a PS3 or Wii? And why?,"wait six months and pay half that, as the price will surely plummet.",I think you should get a PS3. for one it has the new blu-ray disc technology and second jak and daxter is for PlayStation and the best games of all times in my opinion next to ratchet and clank and sly cooper. so if you want a better chance of more games like that I'd go with PS3 i do know their coming out with a new ratchet and clank game for PS3 and if you have never played ratchet and clank i highly recommend it.,ps3 is way better than a wii,ps3 because da wii does not have da best quality graphics like ps3,"Get a Xbox 360, great graphics, great shooters you wont regret it, or get a kiddy Wii!! HAH!",are asking me?i think u should get playsation 1and save,you should get ps3 its unbeliable    bye gonna go play my ps3  later,"wait six months and pay half that, as the price will surely plummet.","You can buy 3 Wii's.....2 for you, 1 for me....Sharing is Caring....",It depends do u like to be in the game with the Wii or would u rather have a ultimate gaming experience that u could on use with a regular game pad with the PS3.,"I'm a Wii-person but since you like 'NBA games with nice graphics' than your choice would be PS3 but they won't have anymore of those till March(unless you got $2,000 for ebay). The Wii is sold out also but Nintendo stated that there will be more before christmas. Which one should you buy? In an honest opinion you should buy the Wii, extra nunchucks and Wii-Motes, RedSteel, Zelda, and Far Cry. The shooting games for the Wii, like red steel, are very intuitive because your Wii-Mote literally turns into your gun. The B button under the Wii-mote even makes it feel like your in the arcade, playing a first-person shooter with the Wii was one of the greatest experiences I had in gaming. I haven't played Far Cry but it does have good graphics and its a good first-person shooter. Zelda is a good, deep adventure game that is similar and even better than Jak and Daxter. Personally I would get the Wii(I already have it) but who cares if you can just get both.",I heard that you really can't utilize the great graphics of the PS3 without a HDTV.  So if you don't have high def quality in your TV then get the Wii.,"If u have $900, just get both. That way, you don't have to choose and you can play games with great graphics with other big guys and play with your little siblings as a family.",YOu should buy the ps3 if you are a hardcore first person third person or adventure kind of guy If you are the playful pick and go or children game kind of guy the wii is perfect

there is a third option u can also buy xbox 360 its very famous too","Wii, More cheaper more creative and better.","The PS3 is amazing! But its not worth $600 to $700. If you really want a PS3, wait a year or two when the price comes down a little bit.

I will able to play all of my favorite games on it and I can't hardly wait to play the new Zelda game.,PS3. it can backplay all previous playstation titles. and it has blu-ray discs which can fit so much more data on so that means games on it r gonna b so much beta,"atari, sega genesis, and the original ninrendo were the best :) lol one two or three buttons simple... not this complicated crap they got out now.. soon your gonna be downloading ringtones, and checking your email from your controller lmao...",defenity the ps3 its got better graphics it has blue-tooth controllers. Its AWSOME.,"If I wanted the more popular games and better graphics, I would go for PS3 and Xbox 360.

I've been on the Sony bandwagon for way too long. (Got the PS1 and PS2). And I've been playing Nintendo's console predecessors since I was a teenager in the late 80's. Time to ride the XBOX now.,I WOULD PREFER A NINTENDO DS LITE THEY ROCK!!
ps3,wii,what new console do u want? PS3 or Wii?,the wii has crapy games and the ps3 is big lumpy and doesn't work as good as the 360 so i still think the 360 is better also because the performance is better on the 360,"PS3 all the way. lets consider the differences.  PS3 has full HD support. neither the Wii or the 360 have anything close to that. PS3 has blu-ray compatibility. The Wii has nothing of the sort. and the 360 requires you spend $200 to play HD DVDs which arent even as good as blu-ray discs. Ps3 can store up to 60GB of music movies and games. 360 can store 20GB and Wii can store jack shit. Ps3 had games like resistance, Lair, Full auto 2, Motorstorm. the only good game of the 360 is halo 3, which wont be here until next november. PS3 has the option of HDMI, AV, Coaxial, or component output, the 360 gives you one cable that will use either A/V or Component, and they have the nerve to call the component output HD. wii makes you use AV. The Blu-ray discs used for PS3 games make the games enormous, and worth much more time. i beat gears of war on the 360 in 9 hours. i have been playing resistance for 12 hours and i am about one quarter the way through. the Wii isn't even worth mentioning here, all their games are aimed at children and can be finished with within 4 hours.  there is really no question as to which is better. the only reason you may hear negative things about the PS3 is because people have decided to jump on some PS3 hating bandwagon. they are the same ignorant dipshits that barge into best buy to buy an iPod without considering other players by creative.  'Gotta get an iPod, thats what everyone else has, everyone hates the PS3, i gotta hate it too'  come on, grow up, get your own opinion.",I prefer the Intellivision from the 1980's.  I bought an official Intellivision CD-ROM with 25 games.  Nostalgia...,"neither, I want a good book.",the wii has crapy games and the ps3 is big lumpy and doesn't work as good as the 360 so i still think the 360 is better also because the performance is better on the 360
ps3,wii,"Whats better: Psp, Ps2, gamecube, xbox, xbox 360, ps3 or Wii?","So basically the Wii has the power of a PS1? Uhh... why do I want to pay $250 (and like another $100+ for extra controllers, etc.) for this? I mean game play is great but if I can get 360 for almost the same price with way beter graphics and 75% more power, why would I get the Wii? Because I can wave my controller around to play? I think after an hour of playing Zelda (or whatever) and flicking my rest around everywhere that would suck. Carpal tunnel syndrome anyone? 

Seems like Nintendo couldn't compete so they just geared this towards little kids or something.

For portable game playing power, then the PSP as it's the only 128bit handheld. For game play (as in how good the games are to play) then the Gamecube, Wii + don't forget the Nintendo DS.

Sure Wii is nicer on the pocketbook, but Nintendo has tried this before with the gamecube and N64 and neither has sold as well as its Playstation counterpart.","It's going to be a nice tight race between Microsoft and Nintendo, because I think Sony screwed up too many things on their launch, from the insane pricetag to the fact that it has problems playing a ton of PS1-2 games.  And the damn thing weighs 15 lbs--I don't even think my PC weighs 15 lbs! The 360 has awesome graphics, great games, and cool downloadable content for those users willing to pay the $60/year for Xbox Live Gold.  Add to that the simple stuff, like good controller design and an intuitive user interface and you've got yourself a good solid system. The Wii--while lacking a bit in the graphics department (the Wii's graphics are comparable to the original Xbox)--is absolutely incredible!  I think Nintendo is gonna hit the jackpot with this new controller design (as long as the game developers don't screw it up, that is)--and it's so easy to use that they will definitely be appealing to more than just those who call themselves gamers.  While it's still a bit too early to be judging this one (particularly because a console's game library holds a lot of weight when it comes to popularity and longevity) it's got a great start. ~Scottie","It REALLY depends.. on current view from what the companies say... I would have to say this year and maybe mid next year.. The Wii and the 360 will dominate the household.. Then next year the PS3 will come into play from gamers wanting to give the PS3 a try and have all 3 consoles in their household.. Thats when Halo 3 and the new good PS3 games come out, and by then everyone will have a Wii or a 360. But it really depends on the time and how their planning and promises go..","probably PS3.

Nintendo Wii-  Strengths: cost:about $250, you wave a controller to control on-screen action, you can download games (for a fee) for every previous Nintendo system. Weaknesses- It has the least impressive graphics of the three new consoles, unlike the other systems, the Wii won't play DVD movies right out of the box. Coolest Feature- Wii Sports: you wiggle, point, and wave the unique controller to swing bats and rackets in your favorite sports. Even better, the game comes free with the Wii. Sony PlayStation 3-  Strengths: it comes with a motion-sensing controller, you can play all your PS1 and PS2 games, It's the most powerful and high-tech of the three. Weaknesses- Basic model costs at least $500, It'll be a while before many kids' games come out. Coolest Feature- Blu-ray DVD playback: A new high-tech disc format, Blu-ray holds six times more data than a regular DVD. Blu-ray DVD movies look incredibly sharp on high-definiton TV. Microsoft XBOX 360- Strengths: Feature-packed online gaming, a lot of power for $300-$400, has the most games right now. Weaknesses- So far, very few kids' games, online multiplayer gaming costs $50 for 13 months. Coolest Feature- XBOX Live Arcade: Play free demos online or buy fun puzzle, arcade, and action games such as Geometry Wars for between $4 and $15. It's like a store that never closes!",PS3 Coach,i say you should wait a few months because the x-box portable is coming out soon,Wii,The Wii,Xbox 360 is the better buy than PS3. Then again a lot depends on what games you want to play cause the different games only work with different consoles.,"Xbox 360, better than the Wii. However, the PS3 does not have rumble controllers, and it does not allow you to download media while playing a game, unlike the X-Box. In addition, the PS3 online is very user friendly and problems have been reported. For 399, get the Xbox 360 and save yourself from the disapointment","The guy above does not know what he's talking about. Go with the 360. You have Unreal tournament 2007, Gears of war, The elder scrolls, Viva pinata, Halo 3, posably metal gear solid 4, Rainbow six vegas, some raceing games, and ect; I could go on. The 360 is nearly equal to the ps3 in power; also the ps3 is harder to devlop games for, so expect games to look like crap for at least the next two years. Trust me, the 360 has expandable ram, more ram, and generaly more power. All the ps3 has is one extra teraflop, witch is at a floating point; somthing that game devlopers hate, and will not touch. The 360 will also play all of your x box games, provided you have a hard drive and x box silver; x box silver is free by the way. I'd go with 360 as I have all three systems, and like it the best; looks beter than all of the systems. The wii would be second in my opinon. It looks about the same graphicly in compairason to the ps3, cost less and has more replay value. At least with the insane mouse game. It's up to you; but I strongly advise the 360.","I would recommend for you to get the Play Station 3, but wait for the price to go down. With the price being $600 dollars. This is absolutely outrageous. That's my perspective:)"

ps3,wii,"ps3, wii, or xbox 360? which system is gonna have the better games also?","Wii, without a doubt. 

First off, unless you want to fork out about $1000 dollars the PS3 doesn't offer you a lot for your money.

Second, Everyone is talking about next Generation gaming, but all you hear is crap about the PS3.  I mean come on, would you pay $600 for a DVD player?  Cause that's basically what all the hype over the PS3 is about.  If you really want something with a 60 gig hard drive and stellar graphics, you might as well by a DELL! You'd probably have about the same selection of games.  I'm not saying the PS3 doesn't have it's selling points, but it's being waaaay over rated (as was the PS2 at launch).

As far as Next Gen gaming, the Wii has it locked up.  With the new interactive controller, and the DS link up, the Wii is changing the way video games are being played.  Plus, being able to download all of the oldschool games that I loved, and playing them with enhanced graphics will kick some major heiney!

And for those who will say that the ""tech specs"" of the Wii make it inferior to the PS3, I say, get your facts straight.  Nintendo didn't release any tech specs on the Wii.  Their statement said that they didn't want it to be compared to the PS3 on that level, because that's not what they were going for in this system.  The Wii is something that can't be compared to the PS3, because Sony could never be imaginative enough to come up with something like it!

Looking Forward to Most: Resistance: Fall of Man Wii: i hope it will be great, the control looks incredible and the games look allright too. the only thing im nervous about is the controller works well or not. also being able to get ony nintendo games is great (is there going to be a super smash bros??)

When you SHOULD get a ps3: 1)AFTER a SEVERE price drop 2)AFTER killzone and/or MGS come out (but if you did not like the first killzone, you may not like the next) When you SHOULD get a Wii: 1)now, go play zelda, monkeyball, and rayman, next year you will have SSBB and metroid.

The PS3 will probably have more 'adult' games but that doesn't necessarily mean better games.  If it makes a difference the PS3 is much more expensive (more then twice) and harder to come by, plus Sony has had a horrible time with getting it manufactured and getting it supported.  Either way they will both be good consoles but for the short term the Wii seems to be the better buy.","well my personal opinion is that i 'want' a ps3, and i will get it after the price goes down, but the wii is such a good deal and it looks so fun i want it too, ill probly get them both, but im sure i will get a wii first then a ps3 after it gets reasonable in price","A Wii.

Graphics were cool and game play fantastic, even for beta games.  I got my PS3 free from my landlord who works for Sony in Foster City, CA three days ago and am impressed!  It's a great investment!",I would go with Wii for sure. It has better features than PS3 like the blue-tooth movement. It also has all the classic characters like Mario and Link.

They are just different.  www.Cnet.com does a really good side by side review and can probably answer any questions you have about them. http://reviews.cnet.com/4321-6464_7-6551960.html?tag=cnetfd.ld2 Personally I have an Xbox 360 and I like it a lot.  If you like First Person Shooters (FPS) then i would recommend it.  The just released Gears of War had great reviews (9.6/10 on average) and the upcoming Halo 3 are great FPS.  And the rumors about overheating...erroneous, only less than 1% overheated and that was due to the new manufacturing techniques that were used.  Any new piece of technology is going to have some errors.  Even the PS2, when it first released had some issues. Also, if you are looking to play online.  Defiantly get Xbox 360.  They are 3 years ahead of both other consoles with Xbox Live. If I were you, I would choose the system that will have the best games for you.  That is what it all comes down to anyway.  After all it is a video game console.","I believe the type of system depends on what your preference is. First you need to consider what you like in terms of graphics. If your interest is solely on crisp beautiful graphics, then you have to rule out Wii. If you don't mind too much about graphics and gameplay is priority, then you need to ask what kind of gameplay you like. Wii, being most different from the other two systems, have games that attract more wider audience. The gameplay leans toward fantasy over realism. If you are interested in board games and entertaining guess, then I'd highly suggest Wii. But, if you're more of a single player or playing platform games online, then you should look towards PS3 and Xbox 360.  The problem with comparing Xbox 360 and PS3 is that they are still in their early stages. In other words, there aren't enough games for both systems yet. If I was to narrow down between Xbox 360 and PS3, I'd put my bet on PS3. The reason is because Japan prefers Sony over Microsoft. So, in the future, you'll see more games on the PS3 than Xbox 360."

I'm also interested in the Xbox 360. I've played some COD2, PDZ, and DOA4 on the system and have had a lot of fun with each.  $400 is a lot of money though.

. . . of course, it's less than $600.  Contrary to popular belief, the PS3's CPU is actually less powerful than the 360's for general processing tasks.  It is indeed about twice as powerful at floating point calculations, but most game processing is not floating point.  The extra money for the PS3 is not for more power, it's for the blu-ray drive.  Quite honestly, I have no interest in blu-ray right now.  Regular DVDs have enough useless DRM, and they look great on HDTVs.  No need for blu-ray.

Because it is here and the others aren't.,"The nintendo was running off of 3 sony processors when it ran at E3, the Xbox360 has already proven itself unstable. As the Nintendo relies on sony, and sony is building its own custom solution, Im betting the sony one will take the cake as every sony machine has upon release into its market. If you doubt it, look at the real time rendered FF7 Video that was shown on the PS3 prototype.","I know I've answered this exact same question before, but I'll do it again. In the simplest of terms, the 'best' system is the one with the games you want to play on it. These days most of the big games (outside of the platform franchises) get ported to all the consoles, but there are always some games (most notably are Nintendo games) that are only on one console. And, of course, with the radical control scheme of the Wii, it looks like there will be fewer cross-platform games on the Wii and more first- and third-party Wii-specific games. At the moment the Xbox 360 is the only console in the market, so if you want something now that's your only choice. However, by the year's end we'll also see the PS3 and the Wii. So if you're willing to wait, you'll have 3 consoles to choose from. My biggest recommendation is to get the Wii. Regardless of whether or not you get another console, the Wii will be not only the cheapest, but also the most fun of the three consoles, given Nintendo's gaming and controlling innovations, as well as their history of producing fun games. It will also have a great lineup - last I checked, there was supposed to be something like 27 games available at launch for the Wii. I'm not even sure if there are 27 games out for the Xbox 360 yet ;) If you have the cash for a second console, this is where it gets harder. In terms of price, the Xbox 360 + the Wii will cost about the same as the PS3, so that's a big point to think about. Another thing is the PS3, while pricey, is looking like it's not going to be as good as once thought. They've slashed some features and power, and rumor has it the Cell processor (the new technology at the heart of the PS3) will have some serious flaws. In the contest between the Xbox 360 and the PS3, probably the most important factor is the games you want to play. However, the PS3 is pretty pricey and the rumors about the processor flaws has me quite concerned. As for myself, I own an Xbox 360 and I'm definitely going to get a Wii. And while I absolutely love the Final Fantasy series, it's going to take a *lot* to convince me to get a PS3. Note: to the person who said 'The nintendo was running off of 3 sony processors when it ran at E3,' that's 100% *false*. The Wii was running off of essentially modified GameCube hardware at E3. Which means the actual production versions will look even better than the demonstration at E3. And if you want more technical details, the CPU of the GameCube is called Gekko and was produced by IBM.",wii

If you did't already pre-order your PS3, it could be a year before you can buy a PS3 at the normal retail price - so unless you want to wait a year or pay scalper prices, get a 360.   I would wait for the Wii cause I love those Nintendo games, and their online features sound better than 360 Live - you can download any old Nintendo, Super Nintendo, and N64 game and play it.",Wii,"Actually depends on what you want to do. If you require a system that does everything from listening to CD, watching DVDs, playing games, then then PS3 is really the choice to go (I am really speculating here). From past experience for sheer playability and fun , the Wii looks good (again I am speculating without having a go at the end product.) Nintendo does come out with something innovative and fun- look the the GBA. No fancy stuffs, just pure gaming pleasure.",The PS3 contains nVIDIA's latest graphic processor 7800 gtx n the output of this is the best in X-BOX 360 it contains ATI processor which is also the best but the games of PS3 are more n are very good so i preffer u to buy PS3.,"well first off it's not called Ninteno Wii is called the Nintendo Revolution and I personaly say the PS3 is going to be to dang expensive, and the 360 doesn't have enough bang for the buck, now the Revolution you'll be able to download old Nintendo games dating back to the NES and the controller is revolutionary. So I say the Nintendo 'Wii' or Revolution.",PS3 all the way....the Wii and 360 cant even compete
ps3,wii,"Who do you think will win the next console war? Wii, PS3, or XBox 360?","I believe the Wii will win. Though its graphics might not be as high as the rest it is much more innovative and looks funner to play. Graphics aren't everything especially when they're priced so high. Even if someone were to purchase an xbox or PS3 they might end up just getting the wii because of their low price. (That and all of their smart friends will be rushing to get one)

P.S. I don't really thinks its such a really dumb name it actually grows on you. I actually like it now.","To me, PS3 is going to blow everything out. I'm an XBOX fan, and I'm really disappointed",Wii sucks purely because of its crapy name,i think the ps3 cause i heard so much that it was gonna be the greatest system ever,"Tough call.  The Wii is going to meet some unfavorable criticism because of how unique it is, but i think that once people get used to the idea, and that compounded by the backwards controller capability, will make the Wii more favorable than the other two systems. I don't see the XBox 360 matching the competition very well.  There have been various negative rumors about it, very few of which I have been able to confirm over the past few months, which never helps when a machine is so expensive, an initial investment requires a great deal of thought.  Frankly, it seems to be more expensive than it is worth, and games such as Halo 3 are what drive its success more than the superiority of the system. The PS3 is hardest to judge at this point, but I'm going to argue that it is going to be the greatest competition for the Wii.  The full backwards capability with ALL previous Playstation titles is not an insignificant factor by any means.  The utility as a movie player and its on line capability also make me believe it will be a more widely accepted entertainment system, especially among homes where it can be used for more than just gaming. On a personal note, I wish Playstation would just start having 4 controller ports like the other good systems do...","the wii. i heard it can play most any nintendo game like any mario game, for example",xbox360 is goin 2 win i bet gurl,i heard that ps3 will have amazing grahics but microsoft has always been better with gaming because they come out with new games every month and their games are so much more interesting. But xbox360 doesnt have that much difference in graphics unless if you have a HD TV. I agree with the first answer that wii just has a very.... stupid. imagine saying 'im gonna go play on my weeeeeeeeeeee' id rather say 'im gonna go play on my xbox 360 or ps3,XBOX XBOX XBOX XBOX !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Cadillac is owned by GM and is their premium brand.  So both come from more humble origins.  The Japanese produce more reliable cars and after seeing the two most recent releases, the IS250 (& IS350) and the ES350, I'm convinced that Lexus has Cadillac beat in everything important, from overall luxury, quality, and performance to fuel efficiency.  Cadillac is just selling a name and most models have a cheaper GM version (eg, DTS is actually a buick lucerne) and although the ES is just a dressed up Camry, the styling and interior differences really are starting to separate Toyota from Lexus.  This wasn't the case just a couple of years ago but times certainly have moved on.  But keep in mind, if you have the money to buy either and you can afford expensive servicing (which you should) then look at BMW.  BMW is not the upscale version of any car company.

It's quite detailed. For the second, well, it's all about the games. Gamecube has a radically different lineup than the PS2 and Xbox, so it depends on what you're looking for. PS2 and Xbox have similar lineups (a lot of cross-platform games between the two), so the real deciding factor is the franchises - do you like the Xbox-specific games like Halo, or the PS2-specific games like Jak & Daxter? I personally own both a PS2 and a GameCube and love them both. I also have an Xbox 360, so I can play some of the Xbox games, but I only have 2 and probably won't get any others. And with DS vs PSP, if you want to play games the clear winner is the DS. It has the much more innovative and engaging control interface (dual screens, touch screen, microphone, etc) and has a lot more and better games for it. There's a reason the DS is outselling the PSP by about 10 to 1. Pretty much the only reason to get a PSP is if you really want to watch movies on a tiny little screen. And personally, I know of *nobody* who wants that. There's a good reason Sony's UMD format is a huge flop.","Definately the Wii. The 360 and PS3 are for people who want crisp, clear graphics. The Wii is for those who want to have fun.","MICROSOFT, i enjoy all its fun games.",its not called the revolution anymore. its the nintendo wii.,"out of ps3, xbox 360, and the wii id have to say the 360 cuz its the only 1 u can play so far and own out of xbox, ps2, gamecube id have to say xbox cuz its got the best graphics and u dont have to but a memory card out of psp, ds id have to say psp because more ppl have it ur welcome :), Dacadac","For me, it's a tossup between Gamecube and PS2.  I have them both...it just depends on what games I want to play...but I think the PS2 is more versatile.  But I like it better than XBox anyway because I just don't like the Xbox's controllers.  too big.  I just read up on the ps3 though, and i think that sounds much better than xbox360, but I don't have $500.  so....the nintendo wii sounds like a lot more fun and *cough* affordable"

nikon,sigma,"I`m planning to buy 70-300mm lens. Which is a better choice: nikon , sigma or tamaron?","I have used Sigma lenses with Nikon SLRs and found them excellent for quality and better value than Nikon manufactured lenses. My last Sigma 28-80mm lens was bought secondhand from Jessops. It has a very good macro facility and has performed faultlessly for an outlay of well under half  the price of a new Nikkor lens.
I have a Sigma 70-200mm lens bought new that has also been excellent but I did find that the Nikkor 70-300 lens I tested beforehand was difficult to use handheld without camera shake problems, i.e. needed a tripod! Also with the digital SLR 1.5x magnification factor for focal length, such problems would be much greater.
I am planning to buy a D50 and would be interested in hearing of your experience and any advice.","The Sigma f/4-5.6 DG, the Tamron, and the Nikon f/4-5.6 G are all 'cheap reach': slow AF, poor image quality (soft at large apertures, soft beyond 200mm, CA/ fringing), and flimsy build quality. Two others, the Sigma f/4-5.6 APO DG and the Nikon f/4-5.6 D are better, but still budget lenses. As for the macro mode: both Sigmas list a minimum focus distance 3.1' and for the Nikons, it's 4.9' / 5.0'. So pick your poison. Also consider that the Nikons will hold their value better if/ when you decide to upgrade. Or you could simply buy a used copy to begin with. The only 70-300mm worth ordering for the long run (it's not shipping yet) is the Nikon f/4.5-5.6G IF-ED AF-S VR, but this lens costs as much as your D50 body... then again, that's still only a mid-priced lens. --- It just occured to me that most of those Nikon lens codes won´t ring any bells. Here's what they mean: G: no aperture ring - the aperture is controlled by the body D: aperture ring on the lens, but still controlled by the body IF: internal focussing - the front element doesn't rotate ED: one or more glass elements have a special coating AF-S: fast auto-focus VR: vibration reduction","The original manufacturer, be it Nikon or Canon, the kit lens are generally not the best the manufacturer has to offer but are going to be the best quality lens in that price range.  If you want better lens, buy the higher grade Nikon lens.   The only reason the others (3rd party) are in business are because they offer 'acceptable' results for less money.  Just about every comparison I have seen over the last 40 years between original manufacturer and 3rd party lens, the manufacuterer's lens wins.  Better (less) aberation, higher center-to-edge resolution, truer color, and higher build quality.   Many people buy the good body and a 3rd party lens because they can't afford new from the manufacturer.  I have always advised people to buy a used lens before going to a 3rd party.  As long as the glass hasn't been damaged  or the body dented (indicating a possible drop) or fungus growing between the glass lens, then there is no reason not do buy used.  Over the years I have probably bought 15 used Nikon lens and never been disappointed. Norm","Hi, I shop a lot and I always use cheapest prices search engine for all they offer.

playstation,wii,"Nintendo Wii, XBOX 360, or PlayStation 3? Your pick and why?","The best way to choose is to describe your style of play:

Nintendo Wii will attract users to the new concept of gaming. The goal for Nintendo is to attract a lot of customers who dont really play games. The graphics are nowhere near as good as PS3 or Xbox 3 but there not aiming for that. There emphasis is on gameplay and fun. If it will be like the gamecube then the big problem may be its lack of games. Hopefully developers will be able to provide a large library of games for the Wii, that we will have to wait and see.

PS3 the success of the PS1 and PS2 shows that its the dominant system. But with the price tag of 500-600 dollars. That alone is discouraging a lot of people away from the system as it is. There opening launch of games is nice and as the previous 2 systems, they have a large variety of games. Also, a good system to buy for people who like RPGs (Role Playing Games)

XBOX360: Console is already out now. Graphics are also suberb just like the PS3 and for who has better graphics and sound thats debateable. HALO is an awesome game but will take next year for that to come out. They have a big emphasis games on FPS (First Person Shooter). Break it down to this.

Nintendo: Innovative, User Friendly, Kiddy Games, not as expensive as the other systems. 
XBOX360: Best System for Online Play (but requires a fee of course)
PS3: High Price Tag System but will also have the largest library of games to choose from. 

My overall choice, Nintendo Wii mainly because its something different and the Wii sports looks like a lot of fun to play. And I also have a lot of fun with friends who come over and we play mario party. Big time fun factor with 4 friends in 1 room. Hope this helps =D","The best way to choose is to describe your style of play: Nintendo Wii will attract users to the new concept of gaming.

Actually, since I already have a GC (and the fact it's compatable) and really don't want or particularly need online play (yes, it's nice, but I don't like HALO style games on consoles), I'm going with the Wii. As for 3rd party, Wii's confirmed lauch titles from Activision (Call of Duty 3, Tony Hawk), Square-Enix (FF), SNK, Ubisoft, THQ, Konami, and of course SEGA. Not to mention the Virtual Console titles from both Genesis and TurboGrafx 16.","I pick the Nintendo Wii, because finnaly you can interact with the game your playing rather than button mashing, the wii has suberb graphics by the way its a New Generation type of system you know.","I, barely having enough money to buy a used Game Cube at $70 will obviously go with the Wii, seeing as its the cheapest and Nintendo promised that there wouldn't be a game for it that costs more than $50(i'll still have to sell my soul to get the $200+/-, though)",never xbox esspcially with this having to use the xbox online crap i am buying a Wii and a PS3 when they come out. why because nintendo does things that are revolutionary and always work amazingly PS3 is supporting all my games i have for ps1 and ps2  and xbox is making you pay to play something you already bought the system already purchased the game and now you need to pay to play it they can bite me this is more microsoft crap that makes me glad i am an apple user,"I dunno ,Its either the xbox 360 or the ps3. mainly because I lost all respect for nintendo after the named their system the gay Wii and the fucked up looking controller.",I dont know,360 B/C IT'S OUT RIGHT NOW. PS3 WILL SOON BE MY ANSWER THOUGH.,"PS3, that is not even a choice, I am just waiting for it to come out, even if I have to sell my liber. :)","First off...better get your budget in mind. Before you even buy a game, the costs for the systems are Nintendo Wii (new name for Revolution) - $200-$250 XBOX 360 - $400 PS3 - $600 If you are a casual gamer who doesn't care about playing online or HD graphics (and with kids in the house) then the Wii is very attractive. If you love online gaming, FPS's, great graphics and are okay without Japannesse games (metal gear solid and Final Fantasy) then the XBOX is much more affordable If you are a graphics wh0re (no shame in that) who has to have the cutting edge technology (no shame in that either) and lots of money, then the PS3 may be your cup of tea. Personally, I can't imagine spending $600 on a system before a game is purchased (Keep in mind that the $500 version does not have the HDMI or any way to add it on so you will never get the 1080P that they promise). You can actually buy a Nintendo Wii and XBOX 360 for the price of the PS3...wrap your head around that... Also if Blu-Ray becomes Sony's next BetaMax then the price of manufacturing games and drives for the PS3 will never come down in price...

It makes the gaming experience more fun and definitly more interactive with others in multiplayer modes.

If you want to shell out the bigger bucks then go for the PS3 if you want a system that is cheaper and gets you active then the Wii is the way to go. My final answer. 

PS3",you cant compare thyem it depends what you want. the graphics and game play of ps3 outmatches the miniscule computing power provided by the wii. the wii pales in comparisonin most factors really but the inovative game play is a great marketting move and an excellent idea in general that makes the right kindof gamer drool and the other kind of gamer laugh.,"playstation 3 better games, graphics","Alrighty firstly to the user who responded PS3 its newer...

Do some research on proper and resourcable game sites and you will know that the ps3 is overall a better system(not saying the 360 is not good but ps3 is deffinetly better as per giving u bang per buck)",I would go with the Wii if you want qualities like the interactve controller and good games. PS3 has no vibration and the graphics aren't that good unless you have an HD tv. The no vibration is a bad thing. Xbox 360 has Xbox live and everybody wants that but it only has one good game Halo3 that will be awesome. The wii does have vibration and sound in its controllers. It is really fun unlessyou want a really big action packed game. The ps3 has a good game Resitance Fall of Man that is a really good game. I would go with the wii if you are old or young,"It depends on what you're looking for, and how big your wallet is.  If cost is an issue, then your best bet is the Wii.  Both the system and games are a lot cheaper.  If you're into violent and gory games, then this system probably won't be your cup of tea.  The controller is a neat novelty, 'though I'm not sure if it would get old or not.   If you're big into High Definition gaming, then your best bet is the PS3.  The blu-ray disc can hold 50 gb, so you can imagine the possibilities with future games (true high def graphics and more features than a dvd format game, which could hold 4.3 gb).    Another big benefit is the ability to watch blu-ray movies (mind you, it cost a lot to buy one right now).  If you want to buy a blu-ray dvd player, it'd cost you over a grand right now, so the PS3 is actually cheaper than the dvd player!  (I think Sony is losing $250 per unit sold).  You'll only benefit from the machine if you have a high def t.v., of course.  I think online play is also free (for now, at least).  Still, $650 cdn for a game machine is a lot of dough to shell out, especially when it doesn't even include a game!  If you can afford the steep price (and patient enough to wait a while until more becomes available), then the PS3 is the way to go. If you want HD gaming right now, then the XBox 360 is for you.  It has a year head start, so there are quite a few games out already.  This means that you should have no problems finding games than you actually want to play right now.  The online community is established as well, but the major drawback is that you would have to pay.  You could buy a premium version of the machine with several games for about $500 cdn, so it's a lot cheaper than the PS3.  However, you won't be able to play HD dvds unless you buy an add-on player for about $200 cdn.  This means that the cost could be as high as the PS3.   Another drawback is that the game runs on dvds, which can only hold about 8.6 gb (dual).   This means that if a company makes a game for both the PS3 and Xbox 360, it'd be more likely that the PS3 version would have enhanced graphics or additional features since its discs could hold 50 gb.  On the upside, the Xbox 360 is benchmarked to be faster than the PS3 (can't remember where I read it). I'm leaning more towards the PS3 because I'm big into HD movies.  Since I'd pretty much have to pay PS3 price to watch HD movies on an XBOX 360, might as well buy the PS3!  (HD dvd movies are a bit cheaper to buy than blu-ray movies, however).  The PS3 doesn't have much games right now, but give it time;  I'm sure there'll be some coming up that will blow everyone away. Mind you, it takes more than good graphics to make a good game!",Wii: great cool controller I have played a Wii  personally and it is very fun new way to game. but if your a hardcore gamer this can't be your main system. if your a casual player definatley consider it or get a Wii and a 360 the perfect combo.  Original games and all your fave nintendo charecters more interactive then any games system.  PS3: I am not a sony hater i own a PSP but i am very disapointed with the  PS3 it is nothing new just better graffix sony needs a new controller and the blu-ray player in the ps3 wont play regular dvds it is way to expensive plain worst out of the 3 unless the games you like only come out for ps3  360: best of all it has a better GPU CPU and more RAM an for less that ps3 it the hardcore gamers dream machine and the best classic style controller out there (Wii remote is not a classic controler) the games aregreat it is the perfect combo with a Wii  conclusion: by a Wii and 360 and spend only 50 dollars more then it would cost buy a ps3 and both of them are better  it makes the ultimate gaming combo,"PS3 blows everything else away.  PS3 has Online gaming for free. Microsoft charges you another $70 for a year of online. and the wii, only charges for game downloads. PS3 has full HD support. neither the Wii or the 360 have anything close to that. PS3 has blu-ray compatibility. The Wii has nothing of the sort. and the 360 requires you spend $200 to play HD DVDs which arent even as good as blu-ray discs. Ps3 can store up to 60GB of music movies and games. 360 can store 20GB and Wii can store jack ****. Ps3 had games like resistance, Lair, Full auto 2, Motorstorm. the only good game of the 360 is halo 3, which wont be here until next november. PS3 has the option of HDMI, AV, Coaxial, or component output, the 360 gives you one cable that will use either A/V or Component, and they have the nerve to call the component output HD. wii makes you use AV. The Blu-ray discs used for PS3 games make the games enormous, and worth much more time. i beat gears of war on the 360 in 9 hours. i have been playing resistance for 12 hours and i am about one quarter the way through. the Wii isn't even worth mentioning here, all their games are aimed at children and can be finished with within 4 hours.  there is really no question as to which is better. the only reason you may hear negative things about the PS3 is because people have decided to jump on some PS3 hating bandwagon. they are the same ignorant dipshits that barge into best buy to buy an iPod without considering other players by creative.  'Gotta get an iPod, thats what everyone else has, everyone hates the PS3, i gotta hate it too' come on, grow up, get your own opinion.","Which is better?? It really depends on what you're looking for. If you're looking for a system with amazing graphics and overwhelming gameplay buy the new PlayStation 3, the PS3 can't do anything the PSP can't do except for graphics (It even has the same interface). If you're looking for a bundle of media capabilities, with a TV Tuner, DVR Recorder, Music/Video Player, Photos, With a Marketplace to buy Movies and TV Shows Buy the Xbox 360. The Nintendo Wii is also a great gaming system if you're into a old genre of games. It has great fun value, it's a great party tool and you can actually interact with your gameplay.  In my opinion, each one sticks out to do a certain purpose."

The Wii offers a new idea in gaming that I think is worth giving a shot.
playstation,wii,Which is better Playstation 3 or XBOX 360 or Nintendo Wii?,"Well from all I have read the best things were for the ps3.

I hear nothing good for Xbob 360 compared to Ps3 and Wii

So now it comes down to

Ps3

VS.

Wii

The only thing that Wii has against Ps3 is the price for the system and the price for the games and maybe some of the other fetchers like weather Ect.

Ps3 Sounded to be the best out of all the only bad things about the Ps3 is the Price for the system and games, the 20 GB hard drive is too small for what you really need for it.

So the best choice I came up with was the Ps3 60GB system I have heard nothing but good things about it.",Nintendo Wii!! Far Superior! had a Go whilst in Hong Kong! It really was Great!,they all have thier points....  The ps3 has the new oblivion with more stuff in it and less load time.. the wii has zelda.. and the 360 is out now... what more do you need buy all three.,"Well from all I have read the best things were for the ps3.

So the best choice I came up with was the Ps3 60GB system I have heard nothing but good things about it.",It all depends on your needs and what else are you going to use it for?beside games... but overall the PS3 is the best gaming console.. in all aspects,"Better is a matter of opinion, but in terms of facts, here's what we have: The Wii will obviously be better than both competitors in price.  It's also the only console of the three to really expand upon motion control and game interactivity. The PS3 has the highest price tag of the three.  This will put a lot of pressure on Sony to outperform the others.  After all, if you buy a $600 console and most of it's games are ports or average at best, you're going to be more than a little ticked.  It's definitely possible for them to go above and beyond with the PS3, but the matter of fact is that the price tag so far is a result only of the fancy hardware (like the blu-ray laser) that they have in the console, not a result of fun or enjoyable games.  We won't really know for sure until it's been released for a while, however. The Xbox 360 has been out for a time now.  It's nothing new.  So while it's hardware rivals that of the PS3, and it's price tag is much lower, I don't see a huge spike in Xbox 360 sales happening any time soon.  For me, the Xbox 360 (and the Xbox) games have been mediocre.  Perhaps best of all so far has been Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, which is also availiable on PC and will be a launch title for PS3. So my prediction is this: with the Wii, Nintendo will be climbing back in the ring as one of the top console developers once again, and this year it'll be a bare-knuckle brawl between the PS3 and the Wii.  With PS3's low ship numbers on launch, however, I expect we'll see more than a few people buy a Wii to tie them over until they can get their hands on a PS3, giving the Wii a numbers boost from both Nintendo fans and Playstation fans alike.  Just my opinion, though.",dude the ps3 is gonna be the bomb and ill prove it  go to a gamer website and look at the ratings for all 3 systems and ps3 has better ratings then other 2 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"the nintendo wii WILL make more money on launch day. It's a FACT. PS3 costs more but the wii has way more units, almost twice as many. The PS3's price is a major issue. Although you do get what you pay for, a really nice dvd player with good graphics. But who cares! The wii has better graphics than the xbox and that's good enough. Plus the controller is the best part. If you bring a friend over to play a game, he would actually be able to play it and would have fun. A PS3, the friend would look at the graphics, and have a bad time playing it. Plus there are no good games for PS3. Nintendo has the best and always will. And for the xbox 360, sales are going to drop dramatically. Who wants a year old system when you can get a newer, more innovative one for less money. Retards, that's who."

playstation,wii,What has better graphics? Nintendo Wii or Playstation 3?,ofcourse PS3,ofcourse PS3,the WEEEEEEEEIIIIIIII!!!!!!!!!!,playstation 3     vote for me as best answer bro,"If we are talking simply the raw processing power to render complex 3D enviroments and textures the PS3 will blow the Wii out of the water. However graphics are most certainly not everything. Nintendo games still look damn good, they may not be HD photorealistc but most of the time they are not trying to be. They are usually just going for cartoony. And with simple styles like that there isn't really much difference between PS3 and the Wii.  Also the Wii is less than half the price of the PS3 and comes with a game.  More games have been announced at launch and before the end of the year for the Wii than for the PS3. The PS3 is in an extreme shortage and you probably won't be able to get your hands on one untill March or April at the earliest.  Don't get me wrong the PS3 is a great system and I will probably get one eventually, but if I have to choose between the two now I am definately going Wii.","PLaystation 3, will have WAY BETTER GRAPHICS THAN NINTENDO WII,  THE SPECS ON THE PS3 ARE WAY BETTER THEN THE WII, THERFORE MAKING THE GRAPHICS BETTER.","PS3 supports 1080p.  That's the best HD resolution available today in the market.   However, you will need a TV that supports 1080p.  Most LCD screens nowadays support 1080i.  The ones that do support 1080p are alot more expensive. Also, keep in mind that the 'looks' of the game hihgly depend on the game itself. I would predict that the first generation of the PS3 games won't be able to take a full advantage of it's great hardware anyways.  So, you shouldn't notice much of a difference. In a few years, the difference will become alot more apparent.",The PS3 does have the better graphics. In my opinion though the Wii has better gameplay,"On a HDTV, the PS3 will blow the Wii away. (not that the Wii won't look good). On a regular TV the will be about same. (Perhaps the PS3 is slightly better, and probably will have better AI, physics, etc.)"
playstation,wii,Playstation 3 vs Nintendo Wii vs Xbox 360-?,XBOX 360!! becuz the games on nintendo wii and ps3 at launch suck. The 360 had better games than that at launch come on.

The Wii isnt just fod kids! My decision the Wii! The wii is gonna be like no other system!  The ps3 will be kinda like the ps2. The 360 will be lke the xbox! The wii will be like no other!

You are trading graphics for new controller style. -If you are the traditional gamer and you want it all then the 360 is the winner for you.        My pick would be the 360.  I'm 31 years old and have loved games since I was 5.  I'm into all the newest tech but don't have thousands to spend on games and hardware.

There are tons of great games available for the 360 as I type this.  As of right now, there are only mediocre games, with the exception of Resistance, available for the ps3.  That will change however as time passes.  Both systems are very capable, and it all boils down to preference.  The Wii on the other hand is in a league all of its own.  It doesn't compare to the other 2 in terms of graphics, but Nintendo has always been known to put out some of the most fun and innovative games.  Either of these 3 systems would be a great choice.

Even if you DO get one, it's a launch system, which means the odds of getting a buggy machine are WAY up there.  Remember all the buggy launch 360's?

These game systems are so heavily anticipated now that they get released before they're really fully functioning machines with all the bugs worked out, and certainly before they have a decent library of games to choose from.  The only thing worth playing on the PS3 right now is Resistance, and there are better games of its kind on the 360.

Speaking of which, the 360 is only marginally less powerful than the PS3.  It's been out a year, so it's actually generally available and has a decent range of games.  Plus it's $200 cheaper.  And seriously, looking at a PS3 game next to a 360 game, you really couldn't tell the difference at this point.  Maybe in a couple years you'll start to see the edge PS3 has technologically.

As for the Wii, it's nowhere near the power of the other 2, nor does it even try to compete.  It's content to be everybody's ""second system"" alonsgside either the PS3 or the 360 - probably a smart move.  The gimmicky thing about it is that the controller is a remote that you use like a wand.  But supposedly it really works in games like the new Zelda, which looks quite cool.",They all have advantages and disadvantages.  The 360 and ps3 have better graphics though.  I have a 360 and its been my downfall this semester. I wish they had never invented any of those things.,Right now the 360 is my pick because it already has a bunch of great games for it. Graphics are right up there with PS3 and the system even has a bit more RAM. But you might want to wait a couple months and sees how the Wii and PS3 do. I'd say it's still too early to pass judgement yet.,"On paper,' the PS3. In reality, you can't get a PS3 right now.

If a game is great what difference does it make which console you play it on.","to put it straight forward: WII is the cheapest and more easily accessible console. its also the one with the 'worst' of graphics. but don't ignore it quite yet, its becoming a huge hit everywhere. having an old school television is best for this. if you DON'T have a HDTV, get this. xbox 360 is the average console. its the one you can find on a 50/50 chance. its priced on the average mark in relation to the next-gen price range. graphics wise, its the standard for what next gen consoles should be. works beautifuly with, or without HDTV. playstation3 is THE system. on paper is plays the rest of the competition out of the water without a second look. but that second look with shatter you when you get a glimpse at the price. its the best system with graphics. and supposeded flawless workings. don't bother with this if you don't have an HDTV. it'll look crappy. period. my friends getting one soon, and we're gonna plug it into my hdtv..can't wait. lol so there it is.

Super Nintendo Is the Ultimate Best!!!!!!!,"Nintendo Wii:  Good:  Revolutionary.  Has something the whole family can get into (or so they say).  Launch titles include Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess and Madden '07.  New online features. Bad:  Has a new type of controller that gamers may not want to embrace.  Also is said to have the worst games out of the bunch, kiddie games. XBox 360: Good:  Good graphics for a cheaper price than PS3.  Has better graphics than PS3 in some games.  Heavy HD movement and a lot of XBox only titles (Dead Rising, Oblivion). Bad:  Not a system for kids.  It's been known to overheat if you leave it in a tight place or if you play it for a long time.  Some games look horrible on Standard Definition (King Kong, Dead Rising) PS3: Good:  The best of the three when it comes to technology.  Blu-ray.  Best graphics.  Exclusives like 'Resistance' and 'Final Fantasy'.  Everything in one system: A computer, a DVD player, a Blu-ray player, a game player. Bad:  Cost.  The system itself is big.

It also has free internet, hd dvd capabilites, and playback(which is no surprise) but it doesnt have new releaseing games that are really worth buying a $600 system.For the system w/best game it goes to the 360 w/ gears of war, which kicks ass, but thats pretty much it, unless you like halo or other certain games exclusivly to the 360. Then there is interactive and family friendly gaming, which goes to the Wii, which also has Zelda Twilight Princess which kicks major ass. Also if you like the oldies nitendo games like Super Mario, Donkey Kong, Mario Party/Racing, and etc. then the wii is for you. oh yeah and the wii has pretty good graphics. so my rating would be: 1 Nintendo Wii 2 PS3 3 Xbox 360 (my rating may not agree with some people) Rating for a Gift 1Nintendo Wii (its $250 bucks with good games) 2Xbox 360 ($300 and ok games) 3PS3 ( $600 and not really any game worth buying a $600              system for, also its sold out and only 6000 units are              being shipped before the end of this year)"

I would get a Wii because it has the best bang for your buck.

The Graphics also aren't THAT bad, sure there are some games that make you want to puke, but games like Zelda and Mario Galaxy are all shiny and curvy, and in many cases show more artistic presence than many PS3 and Xbox 360 games, which more than makes up for the lack of power.

If you want to get the most expensive system just to have it the PS3 will be the way to go.  If you're sick of gaming or want to try something new, the Wii is the way to go.

The 360 has a good lead currently, has the most options while in the game, and has achievements which does help it.  It is 200 dollars cheaper than the PS3, but can't play HD-DVDs with out a 200 dollar attachment.

The Ps3 is a strong system with a lot of power under it but currently no one has been able to tap into the full power of it.  Launch games for it looked far weaker then current gen Xbox 360 titles, and slighty worse than 360 launch titles (Ridge Racer 6 vs 7)  It also will be able to play blu-ray discs out of the box.   however many Ps3 exclusives have changed to be on the 360 and PS3.  

The wii, is the weakest console, but makes up for it with the very unique controller.  It has some significant launch titles (The Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess) and with the controller even games that are similar to the other systems like Call of Duty 3, will play very differently on the Wii.

If you are looking at it from an economical stand point the 360($400) is easily the top, as it's more powerful than the Wii ($250) but still affordable.  The Ps3 on the other hand is $600 dollars.  

You should have fun with any of the systems, the most important thing to keep in mind is to get the ""premium"" system if you choose the 360 or Ps3.  The 360 will give you a hard drive which gives you a lot of options with storage, the PS3 will give you a much larger hard drive, and that'll make life easier.

PlayStation 3- another solid blu ray High- Def gaming system that can store mp3s, photos, videos with internet, text chat, and voice chat and sixaxis controller (part motion sensing) and what not with good games but woa $500 or $600 consoles.... too expensive. Nintendo Wii- I mean if your daughter loves to be active and is fairly young (10,11,12,13,14) with a motion sensing controller where you basically live the game it will be and enjoyable system for her. Neverthe less the graphic are not great and if your daughter is on the older side of the spectrum (19 20 21 22) this game system and games might not appeal to her (Ex:Super Monkey Ball: Banana Blitz). It all depends on what the situation maybe but my answer but what youve told me: Nintendo Wii",The Atari 2600.,"Depends on your daughters age, really.

Is your daughter a hard-core or soft-core gamer (in regards to time spent on the system)?  Either way, you can't lose with the Wii.  But for hard-core gaming (again, in regards to time spent playing) I'd stay away from the 360 and PS3.  You simply don't get tired of Wii.  You can do a LOT on it.  Surf the web, get the news/wealther, make your own personal in-game player, and play with friends across the globe, all straight out of the box.  On the flip side, it's incredibly user-friendly.  3-year-olds can learn to play the Wii.  It's so simple.  Can't beat Wii for just about anyone/any situation.  It's really easy on the wallet too.

If it will be a teen or adult I would say it really depends on who they prefer as a manufacture. My family prefers the 360's over the PS3's. If you get the 360 go for the premium and an extra controller. If it's the PS3 you want go for the 60 GB system because I don't believe you can upgrade the 20 gig system. Also the new HDDVD player for the 360 is definitely worth the $200.00 the moves played on an HD TV are awesome.,I agree with Boris but I think PS3 is the best,"Even though I'm a girl, I think Playstation 3 is better.","Looking at prices the Wii beats them all by a long shot. But sony actually loses $306.85 for each 20GB system sold and $241.35 for every 60GB system, so you're gettin a heck of a bargain. They could of easily put these out for $1000. The PS3 and the Xbox 360 are way better in graphics and sound, no doubt. Also the PS3 is the only one who can play DVD's, unless you want to pay another $200 for the Xbox 360 DVD thingy. So I suggest waiting until they add that on to the 360 before you buy it. But personally I prefer the PS3."

They sold out before they arrived. lol   I would of got the Wii if I had the chance not the Sony because of all the problems first release systems have like the PS1 and PS2 did I never buy expensive things first waste of money.  But I like Sony over the wii for sure once the price comes down a little and the bugs are removed I will get a PS3. Kitty....  Yes the Sony3 might have better graphics over the Wii but the game cube has better graphics over the Xbox360 and the Ps2 and the Wii has better graphics then the Gamecube so when you look at it like that it still has great graphics. None of the 3 new systems will push there graphic or gameplay ability's to the max within the next 2 to 3 years. Game makers so far have not made a game that needs that much power yet.  Ya the Sony3 will be better in 6 to 12 months from now. Way better then the wii or 360.,PLAYSTATION 3!!!!!!!!! thats my opinion but is is a little pricy....the wii doesnt have any upgrades or advancements in graphics so.....,"Okay here are your choices Playstation 3: Pros: Amazing Graphics, Blu-Ray, Good Games                        Cons: Cost a whole bunch, Only reason it cost so much is the blu-ray player , Cant really tell the difference between Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 graphics. Has a history for bugs, Probably no price drop because of the blu-ray player ( sony is already loosing 200 dollars on each system they sell) Nintendo Wii: Pros: Fun to Play, Has a wide assortment of games, Fun Games, Free internet, internet browser, interactive game play.Backward compatible with Gamecube games, Can buy old Nintendo games dating back to the NES.Small.                       Cons: Can not play DVD or CD,Not HD.","i thick ps3 is best from any other games e.g computergames,nintendo,sega","Playstation 3 hands down.  The library of games will not be able to be touched by any other console because of backwards compatability.  Nintendo has always been geared tward younger kids with their titles.  Besides PS3 has better graphics, plays blu ray disks, and all of the best games will for certain come out on PS3.  Unless your 12 dont get a wii","PS3 is better cuz of the graphics and better game library. I'm gettin the wii tho cuz of the price which means i'll be able to get more games. Whoever said the wii is more fun than the ps3 is wrong cuz it is based on the games itself. In this case, PS3 has better games, thus making it more fun. Metal Gear Solid 4, enough said.",you know personally i think the wii and ps3 both suck. i have a 360 and its the greatest system ever. the ps3 costs too much and the wii is too interactive. but if i had to pick id say wii is better than the ps3. by a long shot.,"i dont have either but i want the ps3 i think neither is definitely better, its just a matter of preferance",i think it matters about ur personal preference if u like to be hands on the wii is for u. the ps3 has really good graphics if u have a good tv. The ps3 can do the motion senser to but it is limited in motion but i would still get a ps3 if i were u.  i dont have either because they ranout,the ps3 is way better. at first like 1/2 a year ago i wanted a wii cuz the ps3 look costly to me and wii remote was kool. but now i i would much rather  have a ps3 after seeing games like reistance compaired to redsteel. blu-ray player is a plus and peopel say there not going to use the blu-ray they are always useing the blu-ray cuz the games are in blu-ray. and playing 40 player on line now that is crazy. thw wii only has a few games like metro prime and super smash bro. i like super smash but play 40 players online for free is just so much better and i dont think i can play metro for very long without my arm geting tired and making me quit.,"i agree with sarah on this one, ps3 was released with tons of bugs, im sure future updates will be a much needed improvement, as for the wii, its a nice system, doesnt play dvds unfortunately and most of the games for nintendo are less violence oriented, so in my opinion at this point in time wii takes the cake which one do i think will be better after a new release for ps3? ofcourse the ps3 with superior graphics and ofcourse a huge lineup of games","The Wii, always and forever. It's so much more innovative than anything else out on the market."
playstation,wii,PlayStation 3-XboX 360-Nintendo Wii which console is more innovative of them all???,"I believe that the Wii is way more innovative than the other two. I read a loose non-scientific flash poll that said that 73% of those polled in Japan said they would buy a Wii instead of the PS3. 

But that's doesn't really have anything to do with innovation, just a popular vote for which will do better in sales. I firmly believe that Wii and the 360 will have some serious competition with each other, and only the hardcore fanbase of Sony will buy a PS3.

Its got a better live, than the Playstation 3 its cheaper than the playstation 3 because when that comes out its going to be £425 just for a console that doesn't include a game, or controllers or a memory card. So Sony are just really a bit of a rip off in my opinion, as for the wii what kind of street creds that oh yeah mate i've got a nintendo wii, my advice to all of you is stick to microsoft, their the ones who made windows!

Anyways, based on the E3 (Electronic Entertainment Expo) results, gaming magazines and reporters have said that the best system will either be the XBox 360 (which already has some good games on the shelf) or the Wii (with it's new innovations and amazingly low price). The PS3 is predicted to take second or even third due to the high price and little innovation (the PS3 is just an expensive PS2 with ebtter graphics).

Basketball is thrilling because the athleticism of players are manifested in this sport. whether you fly high, pass great or shoot the ball with accuracy, you can play the game with fun and finesse. same thing in soccer, the adrenaline is rushing because it is hard to make a goal within the given time. tennis and badminton are quite the same but different because of the ball and other aspects of the game. but both have the same goal. they are great because every play is unpredictable. volleyball is fun too. so as you can see, each sport has its advantages and disadvantages, it is really up to the one who is watching or playing the game. just remember you're playing for the love of the game and for great sportmanship.. that's all kababayan...:D",volley ball ! for some reason I just don;t think were you live is a major tennis center. do you have a female philippines national basketball team ?,soccccccccccccer,god i hate those sports!,none of them  cricket is best,Football!

First of all, I'm going to ignore the price...

Wii - Plays GameCube games, you can also download GameCube games from the Wii, as well as NES, SNES, N64, MegaDrive/Genesis, PC Engine/ TurboGrafx-16.  See http://tinyurl.com/yjrrcq for more information.  Also, the controller is a biggie on this one, it's got motion sensing technology far beyond the PS3's.

Gamecube - No reason, disregarding price, to get this one since the Wii plays all GameCube games, and more....

Xbox - It's probably a good idea to get this if you have (or have access to a TON of Xbox games, including ones that aren't on this list: http://tinyurl.com/bfzxt ) Or, if you can't hook your Xbox 360 up to the internet.

Xbox 360 - Get this one if you have, or like original Xbox games (once again, only the ones listed here will play: http://tinyurl.com/bfzxt )...this system does offer 1080i/p hi def TV, as well as 720p, and 480p, and of course, regular def.  There are two packages of the Xbox 360, essentially, they are the same systems but the $300 version is stripped down...to see a comparison, go here: http://tinyurl.com/ydjr48.

Gameboy Advance SP:  Well, it's really hard to compare this to the PS3 or any console, really, not worth getting in my opinion.

PSP - It's okay, you can run third-party software on it, and better than the GBASP, not to mention you can get on the internet.

PS3 - It looks promising, it's got all the features the 360 does, plus integrated wifi, and a 6-axis tilt controller.","1.xbox 360 or ps3 2.wii better graphics,technology, everything...  newest as well but its all opinion really",Okay...

It is like putting a playstation disc in a playstation 2, or playstation 3 now but I'm going by one of our first experiences. It didn't changed anything as far as the graphics.",the graphics should b the same but ima go try as soon as i find a gamecube game,"The graphics should be the same, as the graphics are stored on the CD, not the system. Whenever I play GC games on my Wii I don't notice any difference, but I'm sure with some games there will be a slight improvement as far as the FPS (frames per second) goes, so the game will run smoother.","As the previous poster stated, you can see some improvements if you use the component cables instead of the composite/s-video.  Instead of seeing the game in 480i, the Wii should upconvert the GC games to 480p, which is the same as ED TV."
gamecube,wii,Will the game play for the Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess be different on the Wii system than the Gamecube?,"The graphics will be almost the same for each version, since it was designed for the gamecube initially and the Wii version, with motion control is like a cool bonus...

In the GameCube version, Link is left handed like normal, but in the Wii version he's a righty. Miyamoto himself decided that it would be more natural for players to swing right handed to match the movement most players would make in the real world. Reversing our hero's handedness affects the entire game, as the GameCube and Wii versions are mirror opposites of each other in every aspect, right down to level design (if a path bends right in one version, it'll bend left in the other), flip-flopped puzzles and cinemas.

There also might be download features in the future, such as mini games, extra dungeons and more for the Wii version.

So if you think you're getting the Wii sometime you might want to hold off on getting the new Zelda....


BTW, the control sensor for Wii doesn't make Link swing his sword the way you move your hand, it follows a random order of sword movements.

And to the girl who said the Wii would play with gamecube controllers, the GC controller ports are on top of the system and they don't control the Wii games, only GC games.","Yes.  The wii version will use the wireless motion direction that the wii controllers support for aiming weapons and probably other things to like the fishing rod.  Maybe for swinging the sword as well but more for aiming the bow or hook shot type weapons and fishing.  For monsters , side quests , story , graphics  and items in general I do not think either version is difference. I can see the game play being far greater on the Wii version and sense the wii has game cube paddle slots I bet the wii version can use the wii pads or game cube pad controls.","Yes! By far! Twilight Princess for the Wii will have a cool aiming system, and a better control scheme. I also assume it would have better graphics, seeing that the Wii has a better graphics processor. In addition, since you seem to be getting a Wii, there are several other games which are enjoyable and coming out, like that drumming game I've seen on the commercials and other things. Heck, I dunno your favorite genres, other than adventures, since they are planning to release a Mario Party game for Wii, and they are releasing Wario Ware for it, which is boatloads of fun.",yes it will be different and dont forget if you didnt reserve a copy of the Gamecube version its possible you might be unable to purchase one... (At least not before the guys who get em finish and trade it in)  I work at Gamestop and we heard that Nintendo is only releasing copies for Gamecube for those who reserved it...,"The prediction is that yes, the gameplay will be somewhat different only because the Gamecube obviously cannot support the Wii's sensory controller.","The graphics will be almost the same for each version, since it was designed for the gamecube initially and the Wii version, with motion control is like a cool bonus...

I'd go for the Wii.,I think the game cube for younger kids and for teens and adults the psp or ps2 and the xbox is to hard to get to work and the wii is to much to buy also ps2 games wont work on the ps3 that is all I got!!,360 by farish,PS3 even knowing I haven't played it yet.,ps2,That is a matter of opinion.  All have advantages and dissadvantages.  Ask something less stupid.,"Mainly a matter of personal preference, but I'll go ahead and spec it out for you.... First of all, I'm going to ignore the price... Wii - Plays GameCube games, you can also download GameCube games from the Wii, as well as NES, SNES, N64, MegaDrive/Genesis, PC Engine/ TurboGrafx-16.  See http://tinyurl.com/yjrrcq for more information.  Also, the controller is a biggie on this one, it's got motion sensing technology far beyond the PS3's. Gamecube - No reason, disregarding price, to get this one since the Wii plays all GameCube games, and more.... Xbox - It's probably a good idea to get this if you have (or have access to a TON of Xbox games, including ones that aren't on this list: http://tinyurl.com/bfzxt ) Or, if you can't hook your Xbox 360 up to the internet. Xbox 360 - Get this one if you have, or like original Xbox games (once again, only the ones listed here will play: http://tinyurl.com/bfzxt )...this system does offer 1080i/p hi def TV, as well as 720p, and 480p, and of course, regular def.  There are two packages of the Xbox 360, essentially, they are the same systems but the $300 version is stripped down...to see a comparison, go here: http://tinyurl.com/ydjr48. Gameboy Advance SP:  Well, it's really hard to compare this to the PS3 or any console, really, not worth getting in my opinion. PSP - It's okay, you can run third-party software on it, and better than the GBASP, not to mention you can get on the internet. PS3 - It looks promising, it's got all the features the 360 does, plus integrated wifi, and a 6-axis tilt controller."

Seems like Nintendo couldn't compete so they just geared this towards little kids or something.

There are lots of IDEs that are more powerful and from well known companys. Here are some great IDEs: 1. Oracle JDeveloper 2. Sun Studio Interprise (Built on Netbeans) 3. Sun Java Studio Creator (supporting Server Faces) 4. Eclipse They are all free and you can download them and try them, then choose what's best for you. Goodluck",I prefer eclipse

Toyota has legendary reliability.  Of course, with an all-new design, it is possible (but probably not very likely considering reliability history) to have new problems.  Toyota has had a few more recalls over the last year than previous years, but that's not at all to imply anything meaningfully negative. Cheverolet has been swimming in red ink, but I think they are turning it around.  In the 1980s, Chevy reliability was down.  Try to find a 4wd Chevy truck with 4-speed automatic that hasn't needed a replacement (been there).  However, quality and performance has been **STEADILY** increasing since that time.  I have yet to have a major repair on my Chevys from the 2000+ model years, but I drive them very carefully and go easy on them. The NEW for 2007 Silverado/Sierra trucks look FANTASTIC.  They are available with some fantastic engines.  The interiors are light years ahead of my last-gen Chevy truck. Quality remains to be seen - it's a brand new vehicle. Fuel economy may be a slight edge for Toyota, because it always has been.  However, BE REALISTIC - the diffrence will not be great, will depend more on your driving habits, and if you're really interested in fuel economy then don't buy a truck.  Simple as that - get a Corolla or Yaris.",As Far as the 2007 goes Im no expert but I can tell you I have owned both a 2005 chevy silverado and a 2006 toyota tundra and the Toyota is by far and away a better truck to own.
