You guys that are chasing the PS3 will increase and get your hopes high and when it eventually comes out and it is not good, you will start to complain and whine like babies without milk. You guys should cool down and live in the present and not in the future or past. Play the games infront of you now before dreaming of playing future games. As for me and as of now, the Xbox 360 is a solid choice for me. I hope you guys see the point that I am trying to stress here.',\n",

If you want good build quality and regular software updates do not ever think of buy a phone of Chinese or Chinese-owned brand (except the phones running on Android One). If you have a tight budget, then you can proceed with Moto. Since Nokia’s phone are a bit overpriced, you may get one at reasonable price during sales. Also, the Nokia-exclusive Zeiss optics don’t have any competitor in their price range. If you want a Moto X4, then Nokia 7 Plus is always ahead. But if you want G5S Plus, then go on with it because Nokia 2.1 or 3.1 are the only available phones from Nokia and have a bit low specs. However you can go on for Nokia 6.1 or 6.1 Plus over Moto G6 because of their build quality and stock software anlog with regular updates and security patches.\""

I am not sure Samsung does a better job than Nokia.Well, it depends what you expect from a phone. If you want good build quality and regular software updates do not ever think of buy a phone of Chinese or Chinese-owned brand (except the phones running on Android One). If you have a tight budget, then you can proceed with Moto. Since Nokia’s phone are a bit overpriced, you may get one at reasonable price during sales. Also, the Nokia-exclusive Zeiss optics don’t have any competitor in their price range. If you want a Moto X4, then Nokia 7 Plus is always ahead. But if you want G5S Plus, then go on with it because Nokia 2.1 or 3.1 are the only available phones from Nokia and have a bit low specs. However you can go on for Nokia 6.1 or 6.1 Plus over Moto G6 because of their build quality and stock software anlog with regular updates and security patches.\",\n",

The prestige of being a professional golfer is ever present, but baseball players have a similiar prestige.  But here is what you have to evaluate. How many people in this country, grown men, grown women, older men, older women and children, actually have a baseball bat, a glove and a baseball in their garage or closet?   Now ask yourself how many Americans have golf clubs in their closet or garage (I keep mine in the dining room!) Now ask yourself the same question, except remove the equipment and ask how many times a year the average person plays a game of baseball. Now do the same for rounds of golf in a year. I am sure that you see what I am saying.  Whereas baseball my be the sport that is watched most, golf is played most and is participated in the most.  This means that to have gotten to a professional level means that you are that much better than that many more people....', 'baseball player more fun to play way more money just look at arod', 'baseball look at the money guarantied play or not.', 'Golfer.   Longer career.   Less chance of career-ending injuries. Better scenery.', \"I would rather live my life as a professional GOLFER because it is safer, healthier, and also a more life relevant sport.

       "\"I know a lot more Ruby than Perl, but the primary contrast is :Perl code is much terser than Ruby\\nIf you want terse code that does its job in the least number of lines, Perl is better. If you want expressive, almost poetic and much more generally readable code, and don't mind the cost of a few extra characters, Ruby is much better. This manifests itself in several ways in practice:\\n- Perl One liners (one line perl commands that perform batch manipulation:  of a bunch of files, for instance) are a cult in themselves - see Perl One Liners to get a feel.\\n- Perl is better suited if the primary task is regex - Ruby regex syntax itself is pretty good, arguably close to Perl, but the typical use cases of doing text pattern matching with regexes are better expressed in Perl, in my view. Many developers do regexes with grep, and a natural progression for more complex manipulation not supported by grep is either through sed or awk for a class of tasks, or for more general power, to use Perl.\\n- Perl is used on the command line or with very short batch scripts much more effectively than Ruby, which usually involves longer scripts. So, bottom line, if you do mostly text manipulation and matching, and want quick solutions on the command line or with short scripts, Perl is definitely worth learning in addition to Ruby. If not, perhaps not :-)\""

I am not sure Samsung does a better job than Nokia.Well, it depends what you expect from a phone. If you want good build quality and regular software updates do not ever think of buy a phone of Chinese or Chinese-owned brand (except the phones running on Android One). If you have a tight budget, then you can proceed with Moto. Since Nokia’s phone are a bit overpriced, you may get one at reasonable price during sales. Also, the Nokia-exclusive Zeiss optics don’t have any competitor in their price range. If you want a Moto X4, then Nokia 7 Plus is always ahead. But if you want G5S Plus, then go on with it because Nokia 2.1 or 3.1 are the only available phones from Nokia and have a bit low specs. However you can go on for Nokia 6.1 or 6.1 Plus over Moto G6 because of their build quality and stock software anlog with regular updates and security patches.\n",
