microsoft,sony,which next-gen console is the best NITENDO SONYS  PS3 - MICROSOFT XBOX 360?,How can you even ask this question yet?

You need to ask the question again when all three systems are out!,"[""How can you even ask this question yet?

For me, that sells it more than anything.  Being able to play Super Mario 3, then go to Super Mario 64, then go to Need for Speed Underground all on the same box would be awesome."", ""They all have their strengths and weeknesses.  Its really more or less a view of personal choice.  More then likely people will have multiple next generation consoles when they can afford it (400 dollars for one, 400 dollars for another, with the Nitendo being the cheapest but mostly being considered too kidish based to many).  They all have backwards compatibility in a way, Xbox will have a emulator, Ps3 will just have backwards capatibility from the get go, and even Nitendo I believe.  What it comes down to though is the games, which is why people will own many console systems in the future.  The first Xbox may of been better with graphics, but it wasn't enough to lure everybody from the Ps2 simply because the Ps2 had some damn awesome games.  We'll see how the games fan out, 18 games for the Xbox 360 /NOW/ isn't enough to go crazy over.  Save your money until you can tell which is better by who has the best games that you absolutely must have."", ""I don't think anyone can really that answer yet since all we have seen is the XBOX 360.  It also depends on what you look for in a console and what type of games you like.  The XBOX 360 seems to be heavy on First Person shooters and racing games.  While the XBOX 360 is powerful and has a 3 core processor, Sony keeps hyping its own Cell processor and 512MB custom GPU from nVidia. As the XBOX 360 and PS3 are going head to head it will be hard to make a final decision on this until both consoles are seen side by side but there is still no good way to directly compare them. The Nintendo Revolution has less horsepower than both the PS3 and XBOX 360 but Nintendo is hoping to wow you with their unique controller and games.  The Revolution is not hyping HD content as is the PS3 and Nintendo says the Revolution will have approximately double the specs of the GameCube. While the XBOX 360 and PS3 are around $400 or more the Revolution will be $99 to $149 at launch.  I don't care what walk of life you come from, $149 (despite the lack of power) is an excellent price considering the premiums of the PS3 and XBOX 360. You will have the PS3 only camps and the XBOX 360 camps and the Revolution camps.  Some will want both the 360 and PS3, some will only want the Revolution and some will want all three. In the end it comes down to 'which console meets your demands'.  I fear that Sony is doing what they did with the PS2 and is simply hyping it way too much setting the stage for disappointed gamers. If you want my opinion on the matter, I am leaning towards the XBOX 360 but I am also keeping one eye on the PS3 but I am definitely going to buy a Revolution.""]",We can't recognize objects for comparision,We can't recognize objects for comparision,We can't recognize objects for comparision
microsoft,sony,"wich is better, the Sony play station or the Microsoft XBOX?","For a wide selection, choose PS2. However, XBOX games tend to be of higher graphical quality and performance with minimal loading times in comparison to their counterparts or similar games on PS2. Also, the XBOX online service XBOX Live is far more immersive as a community and tends to lag far less than PS2 online games, since the service is a broadband only community with a full network of proprietary servers. I personally prefer XBOX for its 
superior selection of first person, racing, and online competetive games.

Examples:

FPS: Halo/Halo2, the Rainbow Six series, Half-Life 2

Racing: Project Gotham Racing 1&2, Forza Motorsport, Need for Speed Most Wanted

microsoft,sony,PS3 or X-BOX 360? We all know that these are the latest platforms by SONY and MICROSOFT. But which is better?,"I'm sure you knew when you posted this that we will not know untill the PS3 is out.
Sony will have to really throw some bombs at E3 this year, last years E3 left me a little disapointed.
This is what they have to say this year.

 ""We have always said that the PlayStation 3 will be playable at this year's E3 and that hasn't changed""
 ""We have a three platform showing this year and of course the PlayStation 2, which is now more popular than ever, will share space with the PSP and the PlayStation 3.""
-Sony's Ryan Bowling

Xbox 360 is a great console and with Xbox Live their is no way that the 360 will be Dreamcasted with their earley release.

So pretty much I think it all falls down to the on-line play.

A recent article from PSM confirms that Sony is really making a legitimate attempt at taking on Microsoft’s Xbox Live system.
PSM reports that you will be able to see recorded gameplay footage  which includes your achievements and in-game highlights  you will also be able to make your own video blog. This will be recorded with an Eye-Toy like device and can be shared with your friends. Your video blog will also likely support the PSP’s Eye-Toy function, allowing you to upload videos and pictures directly to your PS3.

So if this is true Xbox may have some serious competition.

Me pesonaly, I think the PS3 will be the best.

-------- Edit -----------

NinjaPirate, rumor had it that the PS3 would be arround 610 and 730 dollars.

Sony has now released a statement saying that it would be arround $500, and with the high-definition and Blu-ray disc functionality that would be a good price.

They jumped on this rumor fast so their may not be as much truth to it as we think.
That was a good point NinjaPirate.","['I\'m sure you knew when you posted this that we will not know untill the PS3 is out.\nSony will have to really throw some bombs at E3 this year, last years E3 left me a little disapointed.\nThis is what they have to say this year.\n\n ""We have always said that the PlayStation 3 will be playable at this year\'s E3 and that hasn\'t changed""\n ""We have a three platform showing this year and of course the PlayStation 2, which is now more popular than ever, will share space with the PSP and the PlayStation 3.""\n-Sony\'s Ryan Bowling\n\nXbox 360 is a great console and with Xbox Live their is no way that the 360 will be Dreamcasted with their earley release.\n\nSo pretty much I think it all falls down to the on-line play.\n\nA recent article from PSM confirms that Sony is really making a legitimate attempt at taking on Microsoft’s Xbox Live system.\nPSM reports that you will be able to see recorded gameplay footage  which includes your achievements and in-game highlights  you will also be able to make your own video blog.

Apple makes a good solid computer BUT if you are not ready for a completely different operating system I do not recommend that you get an Apple. If I were out to buy a laptop I would find a friend who knows his or her computers and then have them help you through the part selection process over at http://www.ibuypower.com. They have a good selection of computers at a very nice price and do not practice those weird gimmicks that places like Dell do where they say you can get the computer for 'as low as xxx' but it turns out to be a good bit more than that because the base parts they use are sub-par technologies. But yeah that's just what I would do. The best thing is to read up on these companies and have that tech savvy friend help compare the 'bang for the buck' factor at all the different laptop manufacturers."", 'If you plan to work on graphics software lie Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Corel Draw etc choose Mac systems.

In this paper a quadrant photoelectric cell adapter is used to measure the centerline of the measurement light beams and the uncertainty of this method is better than 0.02 mm, which can meet the needs of nano-positioning of microelectronic mask measurement. We propose CMOS as cell I/Os for intercellular communications because its wires perform better than nano wires. It is believed that an intrabimodal cellular structure may be created having micro-sized cells having an average cell size of greater than 1 μm to 100 μm and having nano-sized features having an average size of 0.1 nm to 500 nm. But MRAM may also prove better for high-speed memory applications than as a replacement for flash, so it may not compete directly with nano-ionic memory.","After much thought, I realized that  nano is better, because of easier and easier to review in sunbeam.

The Toyota RAV4 will certainly be a hit with tall motorists and their front seat guests, considering that it has better front head- and legroom than the Honda CR-V. The Toyota RAV4 will be popular with taller drivers and passengers in the front seat, due to its greater front head- and legroom than the Honda CR-V. The Toyota Highlander will be popular with taller drivers and passengers in the front seat, due to its greater front head- and legroom than the Honda CR-V.

The Honda CR-V has better overall resale value than the Toyota RAV4. Note, though, that this performance matches the Honda CR-V and is better than both the Ford Escape and Toyota RAV4 , all three competing SUVs ranked very high on compact crossover sales charts. However, we recommend the Honda CR-V, because it performs better in crash tests despite underlying structural engineering that is slightly older than the Toyota's. The video goes on to sell why the Honda CR-V is a better choice than the Toyota Rav4.

The toyota HSD drivetrain is also mechanically much simpler than the Honda IMA drivetrain.","It's simple! Honda is better, because of quicker, weaker and bigger.

The reason are easier, weaker and easier to get into the third row. The Odyssey has MUCH better legroom than the Sienna. The 2011 Sedona is rated at 18/25 mpg city/highway (up from 17/23 mpg in 2010), which is better than the Toyota Sienna with a V-6 (18/24 mpg), but still worse than the Honda Odyssey (18/27 mpg). We left the Toyota dealership and went right back to look at the Odyssey again and my husband agreed that it looked and felt much nicer than the Sienna. The ease of use of the rear fold down seats is phenomenal and better than the Sienna. Thanks to  Honda advances like the three-mode variable cylinder management system and i-VTEC technology, the Odyssey gets much better EPA mileage ratings with its V6, than the Sienna does with its weaker I-4 motor.
I agree the Sienna is lighter then the Kia, I was addressing the Honda in comparison to the Kia. It has no factor-installed towing package and even the expensive after-market ones are limited by how low the back sits to the ground; The seating comfort for adults in the third row is much better in our Pilot than our Sienna. However, the Sienna is expected to retain a high resale value, far better than that of rivals Dodge Grand Caravan, Hyundai Entourage and Kia Sedona , but not quite as good as the Honda Odyssey. Toyota's Sienna gets a 3-star depreciation rating from ALG, indicating that it will lose a greater portion of its value over time than the Honda will. But the Sienna is expected to retain a high resale value, far better than that of rivals Dodge Grand Caravan, Hyundai Entourage and Kia Sedona , a few points higher than the Nissan Quest , but not as good as the Honda Odyssey.","After much thought, I realized that  honda is better, because of easier, weaker and easier to get into the third row.

The reason are easier, quicker and easier to get into the third row. The Odyssey has MUCH better legroom than the Sienna. The 2011 Sedona is rated at 18/25 mpg city/highway (up from 17/23 mpg in 2010), which is better than the Toyota Sienna with a V-6 (18/24 mpg), but still worse than the Honda Odyssey (18/27 mpg). At 4560 pounds, the Odyssey is heavier and less powerful than similarly equipped competition from Toyota, yet with a better six-speed automatic transmission than the Sienna, the Odyssey is as quick and more efficient. Thanks to  Honda advances like the three-mode variable cylinder management system and i-VTEC technology, the Odyssey gets much better EPA mileage ratings with its V6, than the Sienna does with its weaker I-4 motor. The ease of use of the rear fold down seats is phenomenal and better than the Sienna.
Both vans were a couple tenths slower than the Sienna, and, notably, the Grand Caravan is no quicker than our long-term 2008 Grand Caravan. The 8th seat was crucial to me, and I wouldn't be happy with either of these, though this Ody does seem better than the new Sienna. Comment : The new Sienna is much better, and the new Honda Odyssey is even better.

A Corolla is more economical than the accord is gas mileage (MPG are city 30 / hwy 38 for automatic and 32 / 41 for manual) there is less room for passengers in the back and has a more sporty american touch which means u can feel the road while driving. An Accord tends to be bought for ride comfort and long trips, which means it has a smoother suspension. BUt if you really want a bang for your money with money in your pocket. My parents bought a Ford Fiver Hunred for less than the money for a Corolla or Accord. It rides better than an Accord. Passenger room in the back can fit 3 grown people comfortably with more leg room in the back than in the front. They have an option where the back seats also recline. The two captain seats in front are elevated for better road handling. Has the best crash star rating which means you save on insurance costs as well. and has room for the whole PGA Tour's golf clubs. I have driven the Corolla, Civic (older version), Accord, and Ford Five Hundred and i would pick easily the Ford Fiver HUndred not because I like American cars more but the value of the vehicle. Road handling is very important and the view from all angles. Corolla's view is awful trying to reverse with a smal window which is similar to the Ford Fusion. Also Accord has troubling blind spots but handles well. But if you're going with looks i would say the Accord has the best out of all of them.

It doesn't have nearly as a good of an online system or a web browser, but the games on it really are awsome. A choice list of games that make buying one worthwhile are: Mario Kart DS, Animal Crossing: Wild World, Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow, and Trama Center: Under the Knife.

Pros 
*The DS has two screens, and one is a touch screen 
*Has about 10 hours of battery life, with every charge 
*No additional things are realy needed for multiplayer or memory 
*Has a downloadable feature for those people without games 
*Can play Gameboy Advance games

PSP, pros and cons 

Pros 
*Large 3inch screen by 2 inch 
*Can play movies and Music 
*Nice look to it 
*Backlight is good 

Cons 
*The disc slot can get jammed 
*$300 dollar price tag 
*Screen still seems a little small 
*PSP will break if dropped! 
*No realy good games out yet 
*The Sony made battery last about 2 hours of gameing 

If I could choose between the two, it would be the ds. Ds just has always been there, the psp isn't the best thing out there. I know it can do all these things but is it really nessacry? Gamers should stick to the ds (it even has online play!), but if you got the $350 to burn and you want something more than gaming then buy the psp. But a playstation 2 is about $200 and it does all of that, and has better graphics.

The PSP has first person shooters and Grand Theft Auto on it with much better graphics and a more serious nature.  There is also SOCOM on the PSP now which I believe includes voice functions as well much like the PS2 version of the game.

It uses a  proprietary media formats like the Sony Memory Stick for saving data and transferring media between your computer and PSP, and the UMD (Universal Media Disc, think a small DVD in a cartridge) for games and near-DVD quality movies.  It has a wide screen, comes in sleek black, and controls with 2 shoulder buttons, a D-pad, four action buttons, and a commonly hated upon analog nub.  Great looking 3D game play in your pocket, if you like ports and weak sequels of PS2 favorites.

The Nintendo DS is different.  It can connect wirelessly (in person or across the internet) for multiplayer game play, just like the PSP.  Its most striking feature are the system's 2 screens, the bottom screen doubling as a touch screen, similar to touch sensitive screens found on Pocket PCs.  The DS cannot be used as an all encompassing media device like the PSP, but critically (critically, not by sales) it has become a device for playing creative, interactive, and just plain different types of games like the recently released Electroplankton, Animal Crossing DS, and Phoenix Wright: Attorney at Law.  It can control with the familiar D-pad, 2 shoulder, and 4 action buttons, but it can also utilize the built in microphone for voice commands and a palm pilot inspired stylus for use on the touch screen.  It can also play Game Boy Advance games.

The Game Boy Advance was the first back-lit portable handheld for Nintendo, and departed from the Game Boy Advance's ""wide"" design for a clam-shell (which is also what the DS is).  There were a couple of Pokemon games released that connect wirelessly for poke battles, but other than the ability to play both Gameboy Advance games and Gameboy games, it has a library of hundreds, perhaps thousands of games.  However, you'll actually only want to play about 1% of those games.  Both systems are plagued by untold numbers of licensed kiddie schlock that isn't worth the it gets tossed into a year after release, let alone the 30 bucks it would cost to get it new.

In short:
PSP - $250 - Lots of media features and my favorite PS2 franchises on the go.
Nintendo DS - $130 - Nothing but games here, the old favorites from the Gameboy Advance and some quirky, interesting, and fun new things.
Gameboy Advance SP - $80 - A styling Gameboy Advance.  That is back lit.

ds,psp,PSP vs DS?,"Here's some hardcore facts:
I own both PSP and DS (as well as just about all other systems and consoles.)

PSP
Pros:
-Connectable to PCs via USB cables so you can upload videos, games, hacks, cracks, music, plus updates and misc. stuff that you'd want, and can act as a portable hard drive too.
-With the latest updates for the PSP you can browse the internet via WI-FI enabled hot spots or a wireless router.
-PSP also has many movies you can buy on UMDs.

Cons:
-Memory cards can be very bothersome in cost. A 1GB card costs and extra $100. Also the defalt 32M memory card is rather small for music or updates (if you try to get the updates for Wipout Pure your stuck in the mud as you can barely fit 3 out of the current 7 updates on the memory card).
-Battery life currently is very short (7 and 1/2 hours if you’re lucky, usually 5 or 4)
-Very few games as of yet have very little support for the internet features offered for the PSP.

DS:
Pros:
-Touch screen is very innovative and offers a much broader area for future game development. Currently (there are some, but in my opinion) not many games that really use this feature well.
-Two screens is also an interesting step for gaming.
Games (from exp.) very rarely crash and don't have as many graphics glitches as some games are (GTA:LCS) for the PSP.
-Battery life usually lasts for about 6-12 hours.

Cons:
-In comparison with PSP the graphics detail is split between the two screens.
-No internet browser what so ever.
-Not many games (so far) use the WI-FI internet connectivity.

Personally I'd say the PSP is more customizable, but is really only worth the price ($250) if you have your own computer. Half the features require a computer connection.

ds,psp,Which one? Sony PSP or Nintendo DS?,"It all depends on what you are looking for. I have had experience with both and I would have to say neither. If you are wanting to get a handheld system save you money. Within a few months Nintendo is going to release what is called the Nintendo DS Lite in America. It is the same as the Nintendo DS except it is more compact, has better button placement, and the screens are brighter and sharper (same size screens but smaller unit).
At first glance the Sony PSP is better because it is basically a PS2. But there are some things to think about. First off the PSP has fallen short as far as game variety goes. I knows people who have sold theirs because they just don't have that good of a game variety. Another thing is that the black glossy finish on the PSP looks horrible in any sort of light. It picks up fingerprints and oil from your hands horribly. Also its easier to see scratches and such. As far as the harddrive goes, it is rather small and a waste. You may say that its not a problem because it supports memory cards, well memory cards are expensive. Not to mention that the PSP is fairly large...

Ok, about the DS. The current DS is built like a tank. I don't like its design and I don't find it portable. The screens are a little dull in the light also. But this is a Nintendo product so it will be innovative, right? Right. DS means that it has Dual Screens, one regular screen on the top and one touch screen on the bottom. This really rocks because you can control your character and do many things with a touch screen. There are quite a few good games for the DS too and the DS plays Game Boy Advance games. Metroid Hunters is a good action game and it is playable online too. Thats another thing, the DS has built in WI-FI so all you need to do is be at a HotSpot (Mcdonalds have these) or by a wireless network. If you don't have a wireless network in your house you can buy a small adaptor that plugs into any standard USB and sends out a wireless network. But as I said earlier, the DS Lite will be the way to go. So here's the rundown:

1st Place: Nintendo DS Lite
2nd Place: Nintendo DS
3rd Place: Sony PSP

However, Price Wise, The PSP Is Rather Pricey To Get The Most Out Of It, Best Needing A Big Memory Stick (29.99 and higher), Near-PS2 Prices (mostly around 39.99), And Extras (like that 300 handsfree tv base thing), While DS Games Are Cheaper (mostly 29.99) And Doesn't Really Need More To Get The Most Of Out Of It..

The 360 has awesome games, and the graphics match those of the PS3. Developers have said time after time that the difference between the PS3 and 360 are so minor, that no one will be able to notice them. Since I'm not interested in playing Blu-Ray movies, and since I'm interested in the games that the 360 has, I'd get the 360. And even if you don't like the games right now, the 360 will have more games than the PS3 and Wii combined for probably a year (I said combined, it will always have more games than either of the two, or at least the PS3 because it's so hard to dev for), and that means more variety. The DS, is a handheld gaming system. I have a PSP, and I must say, it feels more than a console than a handheld. You might think that's a good thing, but it's not if you want a PORTABLE. With the DS, there are games where you can just pick up and play, AND games that you can play for a long time. I have a PSP, so I know what the games feel like. Since I'm not interested in sports games because you've played on (in a certain sport), you've played them all, I have other games. There are a few exceptions though, like Daxter. Daxter is a nice little platformer that you can play anytime you want, while Metal Gear Acid doesn't allow saves until you beat an hour long mission. Now, the PSP's advantage, special features. Let's start first with web browsing. What a useless feature! It takes forever to type in what you want, and then when you get to a page, it appears all messed up because of the size of the PSP screen. The DS web browser, which comes out next month in Japan, from what I have seen, is a breeze. When you want to type an adress, you use the bottom screen to type in letters by touching, which is much easier. While browsing, the bottom screen provides a overview of the page, and the top screen provides a close up of the space the browser is centered on. It's much easier to use. Music and movies, since I don't have a music player, this might be useful to me. But then, I can just go to the store and buy a 1 gig MP3 player for $30-$50. I don't see music and movies as something very important, but it's up to you. Graphics, the PSP graphics are stunning. The PSP is great at displaying 3D images, and is near PS2 quality. The DS on the other hand is slightly better than the N64. I'd say a bit below DreamCast level. The DS has great games to make up for the step ahead the PSP is in graphics though. The PSP has mostly multiplatform titles and ports of PS2 games though, and some PSP exclusive games are no longer exclusive. GTA: Liberty City Stories is an example, a PS2 version ships two weeks from now. Well, that's my opinion, I'm trying to be as unbiased as possible. I don't own any next generation consoles, or Xbox 360, since that's the only next-gen console that's out, but I do have both handhelds."", ""ds- it is more innovative, and for proof it is killing psp i sales you cant judge between the last three. all will be great as far as graphics but i'm getting a revolution(aka Wii) because it offers a more immersive experience."", ""DS just rocks.

""I like a PSP better than a DS personally beacuse im able to play my favorite childhood games like SNES, SEGA, ATARI, NEO-GEO etc.""
Why, PSP has no games of it's own? I'm sure you really enjoy illegally emulating games. If you had a DS, then you'd be playing new, fresh games, not old games, or PS2 ports.

""Well, I personally think the touch screen is just stupid.""
Have you tried any games that use the feature well? I think you've never touched a DS in your life. Go play Metroid Prime Hunters, it makes a great use of the touch screen, it uses it to make a FPS game possible on the DS. And the touch screen is not the only feature, there is the microphone too. The microphone is used for voice chat with friends on Metroid Prime Hunters, and many other things in Nintendogs.

""The PSP costs more, but it has better hardware and you can also surf the web, listen to music, and watch videos in addition to playing games. The DS is cheaper, but from what I have heard, the games are better.""
Exactly, you're paying an extra $80-$100 for extra junk. And you can have those features on the DS too. There is a web browser coming out in Japan next month (probably comes out a month or two later) for $30, and there are already some third party media players, like the GBA Movie Player from lik-sang.com, it plays movies and music like the PSP, and it can be used on the GBA SP, plus it only costs $25, and uses either compact flash or SD cards. DS Lite + Web Browser + GBA MP = $180, $20 cheaper than PSP, and has all the extra junk. Plus when the DS Lite comes out in the US (June 11th), most likely there will be an original DS price drop. If the price drops, then you save even more money, and you get great games to play too.

Roughly speaking, the launch titles look slightly worse than current PSP titles (not helped by the lower screen resolution). To psp king (2:25pm EST Sun May 01 2005) You just have to get over the fact that the ds is way better than the psp and that no other company can beat NINTENDO. My initial impression: The PSP is clearly superior to the Nintendo DS and its gorgeous screen makes Portable Media Centers look sickly by comparison. As of now, the selection of DSi downloadable games is considerably inferior to the selection and quality of the PSP downloadable games (including the old PS1 classics, which have graphics that look fine on the smaller device).

Third, PSP hardware is way better than DS, but DS gives you two screens, stylus, and built-in microphone, and don't forget that DS's able to play GBA games.

Now, i've used both a DS and a PSP, and the both had thier good points. For starters, DS is Nintendo..a name that's got history, and Sony, they're known for the hip/cool devices. I quite honestly picked a PSP up over a DS becuause the PSP was a sleek unit that i thought a guy my age should carry, vs the DS which looks like it was made for kids and didn't have that flair the PSP did...i didn't wanna be caught sitting on the subway playing a DS.

not to say it isn't good. If you want a lot of the nintendo franchises, it's great. A few of the games that use the touch screen are good, however, i find having to use the screen as a coontrol device in some games is just completely awkard...the PSP has a thumb sick....rock.

the PSP is also not a gaming only device like it's nintendo counterpart. It's got music, movies, both have wifi..with the DS supporting more actual online play than the PSP, which whlile has the ability..i believe the wifi has only ever been used for head-to-head..which is kind of a waste.

I can tell you graphics wise, the PSP's got it. Using a slightly modified PS2 graphics core, the visuals are stunning and a beauty to behold. The DS' graphics are just about on-par with the N64....this is because the DS is only about as powerful as that, plus the usage of memory cards limits what they can do.

UMD's are nice...however, i do remember having problems with one or two of the cases breaking, leaving the games practically unprotected and having to handle the disc to stick it in a case just to play....but they offer a LOT of room so they can do some nice things with the graphics and sound...vs the DS which uses mflash-like technolgy.

It's got music, movies, both have wifi..with the DS supporting more actual online play than the PSP, which whlile has the ability..i believe the wifi has only ever been used for head-to-head..which is kind of a waste. I can tell you graphics wise, the PSP's got it. Using a slightly modified PS2 graphics core, the visuals are stunning and a beauty to behold. The DS' graphics are just about on-par with the N64....this is because the DS is only about as powerful as that, plus the usage of memory cards limits what they can do. UMD's are nice...however, i do remember having problems with one or two of the cases breaking, leaving the games practically unprotected and having to handle the disc to stick it in a case just to play....but they offer a LOT of room so they can do some nice things with the graphics and sound...vs the DS which uses mflash-like technolgy.  but you know, i'm presonally still up in the air. the DS-Lite improved the look, but not the graphics or gameplay...and like i said, i tried playing starfox and i couldn't do it with that screen. I guess i'm just an old school gamer used to the original classic controller configuation and not these new fangled touch screens.  The PSP was able to run some home-written applications for a while, and might still be able to (my psp got stolen) although Sony is tryin to put a stop to it. With that, I was able to emulate all the old NES games on my PSP...which...was really nice because the button configuration almost was similar to a nintendo controler.....Don Flamingo from Punch Out never went down do fast..left-right-left-right-left-right ;)"", 'My kids love the DS but at the end of the day everyone has their own personal preferrences', 'Personally I would buy a PSP, you have wider support from the gaming industry as well as the psp movies on the go.

Roughly speaking, the launch titles look slightly worse than current PSP titles (not helped by the lower screen resolution). To psp king (2:25pm EST Sun May 01 2005) You just have to get over the fact that the ds is way better than the psp and that no other company can beat NINTENDO. My initial impression: The PSP is clearly superior to the Nintendo DS and its gorgeous screen makes Portable Media Centers look sickly by comparison. As of now, the selection of DSi downloadable games is considerably inferior to the selection and quality of the PSP downloadable games (including the old PS1 classics, which have graphics that look fine on the smaller device). PSP has better games, ""even though theres little"" more cool features, and IMO the flying disk problem is overrated and the handheld holds together ""blame the nintendo dudes for making these things out to be worse than they really are"" .","smth wrong in answer generation, please try again"

Some minor points to worry about: 1)   To make use of either the DS Lite or PSP while he's in the gym or on a plane, he will need a pair of noise-isolation earbuds from either etymotic or shure.     That'll cost anywhere from an extra $100-$200.    2)  The PSP requires an extra memory card to do all the fancy movie stuff.    1 GB memory stick duo pro runs about $60 on sale, and the 2 GB is....$80 on sale?    Keep your eyes peeled for sales at frys or best buy, etc.  The DS Lite is not without its merits...it has good group games but that doesn't sound like something your husband is going to be involved with.      One great game that's entertaining that I've tried is Trauma Center, you can get that off of Amazon but none of the retail stores sell it anymore.      I have both systems, I like the PSP better.    For people who are working, it's just the better alternative even if the numbers in sales don't reflect that. I just bought a bunch of titles 2 weeks ago, here are some that you might want to get for him: Lumines Lumines 2 Syphon Filter:  Dark Mirror  (fun!  Playing it now....)

There are still many people who don't have a PSP, or are looking for a better gaming experience than Apple's iPhone or the Nintendo DS Lite. Looking at the first two years of sales of PSP and the first two years of DS, one can see that PSP has actually sold better than the cumulative sales of DS and DS Lite. If it's got better 3rd party support than the 3DS I might bite (looks impossible right now but who knows), otherwise I'll try the 3DS Lite somewhere down the line. Sony launched the new PSP, which is cheaper and slimmer than the initial model, on Sept. 20 in Japan in a bid to compete better with Nintendo's hot-selling DS Lite. The games are more in depth and the graphics are superior to the DS lite that I own.
And another thing qqman22 how dare u give the Ds lite a 5.0 i mean come on Ds lite may have crappy graphics but its definetly better than the PsP. Nintendo recently made a rumble pack for the DS lite, yeah thats cool, but you dont see people talking about it like its the greatest thing ever, like its a reason why DS is better than PSP. accept the truth (1:57pm EST Sun Jul 30 2006) The nnintendo ds lite is better than the psp any day. Ken, the differences between the DS, DS Lite, DSi and, obviously, the 3DS are greater than the differences in the PSP-1000, PSP-2000 and PSP-3000. Even without them, the increasingly tiny handheld's Slim & Lite revision reached the 1 million milestone two weeks quicker than the console nobody's calling the PSP Chunky.","I came to the conclusion that psp is better, because of  and cheaper.

Roughly speaking, the launch titles look slightly worse than current PSP titles (not helped by the lower screen resolution). To psp king (2:25pm EST Sun May 01 2005) You just have to get over the fact that the ds is way better than the psp and that no other company can beat NINTENDO. My initial impression: The PSP is clearly superior to the Nintendo DS and its gorgeous screen makes Portable Media Centers look sickly by comparison. As of now, the selection of DSi downloadable games is considerably inferior to the selection and quality of the PSP downloadable games (including the old PS1 classics, which have graphics that look fine on the smaller device). PSP has better games, ""even though theres little"" more cool features, and IMO the flying disk problem is overrated and the handheld holds together ""blame the nintendo dudes for making these things out to be worse than they really are"" .","smth wrong in answer generation, please try again"

The DS had two screens which is really fun, like having two monitors for a pc (really amazing once you get used to it).  They both have wifi.  With the PSP, you will get better graphics but the DS also has good graphics and really fun games.  The biggest difference between the two systems is the touchpad on the DS.  It allows for a totally new gaming experience.  The Dual screen support also adds to the unique experience as the actions goes from one screen to the other or one screen is used for a inventory screen while the other is what you're mainly focusing on to play.  I would highly recommend getting the DS as it's cheaper, still has equally great games, the DS Lite looks really cool in itself (kinda like an ipod) and is very interesting to play in many ways.  Trust me, you won't regret getting one.   As a sidenote, the screens on the DS Lite is equivalent or near equivalent to the PSP screen.  The color and resolution is very good on both.  The original DS screens, though,  were not so great.  I also shy away from Sony Consoles because they tend to have disk read errors.

ds,psp,which is better ds or psp?,"It all depends on what you want to do.  If you want to play games, listen to music, watch movies, etc...then you'll want a PSP, simply because the DS doesn't do those things.  If you're looking simply for a handheld gaming console, go with the DS--the touchscreen is just so cool to use and it's awesome to see how different developers incorporate that feature into their games.  In addition, there are a lot of good games spanning a wide variety of genres for the DS.  That's not to say the PSP didn't have good games--it just didn't have enough to make it a good gaming investment (my roommate returned his after playing Mercury and MegaMan Maverick Hunters).

And in my personal opinion, the PSP felt a little bulky in my hands, and the little ""nub"" it's got (that's somehow supposed to substitute for a control stick) is hard to use with the precision that the games require.

Games you should check out for the DS to get you started:
Meteos - falling brick-style puzzle game, easy to learn and unending difficulty potential
Tetris DS - well...it's Tetris.  'Nuff said.
MarioKart DS - it's MarioKart, and you can't go wrong there, either.
New Super Mario Bros - A complete reimagining of the 2D platformer, incredible nostalgic value on this one.
Starfox Command - great combat flyer and good use of the touchscreen.
Metroid Prime Hunters - it's like Metroid Prime, but with other cool bounty hunters and multiplayer.
Brain Age - an amusing educational game that is supposed to activate the prefrontal cortex in your brain.  Basically keeps parts of your mind active that don't do much once you're out of school--it's fun if you're into that kind of thing.
Nintendogs - it's a really fancy Tamagotchi (remember those?)--you have a little puppy that you feed and play with and stuff.  I've heard it's fun, anyway.

Those should get you started, there are tons more and of course what you play is all dependant upon your tastes.
http://www.gamestop.com/ - if you search through their list of DS games, you'll probably find something else that looks cool, too.

Oh, and the DS also plays GBA games.  Hope all that helps, good luck!

It's addictive."", 'Psp the disks are cool, Madden 07 midnight club3 dub edition Gun  Cars Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories NBA 07 Miami Vice', 'The PSP is the better then the DS', 'Both of the systems have their pros and cons.   The main things to look at in a hand-held video game system are: graphics, features, games, price, and durability. Your age is also a factor in deciding which one you would enjoy the most. Both systems are really fun but, nine times out of ten one will suit you more than the other.   Nintendo DS:   Pros: The price is the first thing to look at. The price is currently $129.99. This is a fair price for what you get. First, it has a built-in Game Boy Advance. The price of a Game Boy Advance SP on its own is $79.99. That means that the DS part is only $50. The DS has great graphics for its price! That is not all, it even has two screens. One is a regular screen, but the other is touch screen. It is used for anything from petting a dog to aiming a gun. Last, but not least, you can play online. This means that if you have a wireless router at home you can play for free. If you do not have a wireless router, you can pay $35 for an adapter.  Online you can race, shoot and play with people across the world.   Cons: If you are looking for more mature, traditional gaming, the DS will probably disappoint you.  The Nintendo DS offers a wide selection of innovative games that focus on using the touch screen.  The touch screen is both a pro and a con.  In the game “Greg Hastilings Tournament Paintball Max,” aiming with the touch screen while pressing buttons to fire and reload can be a pain.  One other issue with the touch screen is that the stylus is easy to lose.  DS comes with two of them, but you can purchase three more for around $5.00.         Sony PSP: Pros: Sony PSP is a sleek, nice looking, hand-held gaming system made by Sony. It is designed to attract the “I-pod audience.” This system can connect to the internet, play movies, hold photos, and play music. The PSP has graphics similar to the Play Station 2[1].  The games look really nice on the PSP. This system is the only hand-held system to have a mini built-in joystick. The joystick is so small that you can barely see it in pictures, but it works really well.  The stick makes racing, shooting, and walking a lot easier. PSP also has arrow keys for tasks such as moving through menus, entering text, and performing more precise functions. As if that were not enough, this work of art can connect to the internet, and surf the web.   Cons:  Every positive on the PSP comes with a negative.  The games offered on the PSP aren’t very innovative.  Most of the games have previous versions which appear on other TV based systems (Nintendo Game Cube, Microsoft Xbox (360), and Sony Play Station 2).  The ones on the TV based systems are usually longer and easier to navigate because their controllers have more , larger buttons. Music and photo storage are cool features, but are limited by the PSP’s memory.  If you want to store more than five songs or ten pictures you would have to buy a memory stick, which can cost between $30 - $100.  You can buy movies to play on the PSP, but many movies don’t come in this format.  There is software that converts regular DVDs to the PSP format, but this costs around $40, and requires at least an $80 memory card.  The movie Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith, for example, took up one gigabyte of memory!  The Internet connection is a great idea, but it’s really hard to navigate.  It’s difficult to enter text, but it’s even more difficult to correct mistakes.  The last point is that the screen breaks very easily.  A good, hard screen protector costs an additional $15, but it’s well worth it.      Conclusion: Overall, they both have many great features and some drawbacks.  It all comes down to which system you prefer.  If you are attracted to new technology developments, then you are a Nintendo DS person.  If you enjoy more traditional, familiar games then Sony PSP is for you.', ""It all depends on what you want to do.

There are screen protectors for Psp, and the screens scratch and get ruined no easier than a ds!

Dragon Quest IX , a main series release, on the DS rather than a technically superior Sony console. For many people that could be something that pushes them towards the PSP over the DS, and in that sense Nintendo has to release games that are far and away superior to what Sony is dishing out, because the DS will almost certainly have fewer games released.

If the DS has more games you like but it.  Same for the PSP. **********My PSP Rant********** True, the PSP can play music and you can watch movies but it does neither of these things very well.  That is the usual problem with these types of multi-task devices; they do many different things, but none of them well. As an mp3 player the PSP is one of the larger and more difficult to use and you have to buy expensive Sony memory sticks to expand the memory of the system. As a movie player the PSP is a joke.  Let's think about this for a minute.  Who is going to sit in front of this thing for 2 hours to watch a movie?  Answer:  no one.  This novelty will wear off about 45 minutes into your first movie.  Don't forget that if you want to watch one of your favorite movies, you have to spend another 15 to 20 bucks to buy it on a UMD.  The UMD is failing miserably and probably won’t be around much longer.  Studios are losing money and will not continue the production of these disks soon. With some modification and downloads, you can surf the web wirelessly (although not very well; another novelty that will be as useless as watching movies after about 10 minutes) as well as download and store all kinds of media in the device.(buy a video ipod for this instead).  **********End Rant**********  it all boils down to the games.  Nintendo has dominated the handheld market for 10 years because they know handhelds are mainly for younger players and produce the majority of their games accordingly. Adults simply don’t have as much time to play mobile games.  When we go somewhere (adults), it is for a reason, not because we are being dragged by our parents and need something to pass the time. My advice is do not buy either if you are over 15, you simply wont use it."", 'trust me i had a psp but i traded it in for a DS.

Roughly speaking, the launch titles look slightly worse than current PSP titles (not helped by the lower screen resolution).

My initial impression: The PSP is clearly superior to the Nintendo DS and its gorgeous screen makes Portable Media Centers look sickly by comparison. As of now, the selection of DSi downloadable games is considerably inferior to the selection and quality of the PSP downloadable games (including the old PS1 classics, which have graphics that look fine on the smaller device).

There are screen protectors for Psp, and the screens scratch and get ruined no easier than a ds!

For many people that could be something that pushes them towards the PSP over the DS, and in that sense Nintendo has to release games that are far and away superior to what Sony is dishing out, because the DS will almost certainly have fewer games released. Actually no,if you check the 64 and the Gamecube were stronger than their Sony counterparts,this if the first video game console that Nintendo has released that is technologically inferior to a Sony system (Not including the DS and PSP).","It's simple!

Just as the GameCube was a much better piece of hardware than the original PS2, so the DS Lite seems to fit its niche much better than the PSP. Sony launched the new PSP, which is cheaper and slimmer than the initial model, on Sept. 20 in Japan in a bid to compete better with Nintendo's hot-selling DS Lite. But, in the case of dual layer DVD burners, Sony makes them by themselves at this time, and they write DVDs faster with less compatibility problems on other DVD drives than Lite-On dual layer burners.

For someone like me, though, who would hardly EVER use any of the other features available on the PSP and would use it primarily to play games (depending on what games you want to play) the DS is less expensive and there are plenty of fun games available to for it.  Another question to ask is who is the system for because the PSP is geared mostly towards an older crowd with more violent games being available for it. The DS is geared for everyone with a lot of games made for a younger crowd and the community of gamers that like puzzle/thinking/strategy games.  Both systems are awesome if you ask me.

ds,psp,Which is the better handheld game now PSP or Nintendo DS?,"The ds is better than the psp

Ten reasons why a ds is better than a psp

1) Most of the ds games are original and only released for that format - nearly all the psp games have been also released (or due to be released) on the ps2. 

2) The ds is a lot more reliable - psp's are too fragile.

3) The psp is more interested in graphics than game content. Game content is much more important to me than graphics.  I can spend hours playing the awesome highly addictive game Pong on my ds (one of the games on Retro Atari) which much more fun than some of them psp games.  Big suprise Pong is not out on the psp. 

4) The batteries on a psp dont last as long as a ds's.

5) There are too many 'add ons' on a psp that are not necassary for a games console while a ds just does what a games console is designed to do which is play games.

6) More ds consoles have been sold than psp's.

7) The ds has awesome wireless multiplayer action and only one of the players need to have the game

8) The ds has awesome touch screen technology and built in microphone which a lot of ds games take full advantage off.

9) There are more games out on a ds than a psp.

10) The ds is backward compatible for gameboy advanced games.","[""The ds is better than the psp\n\nTen reasons why a ds is better than a psp\n\n1) Most of the ds games are original and only released for that format - nearly all the psp games have been also released (or due to be released) on the ps2. \n\n2) The ds is a lot more reliable - psp's are too fragile.\n\n3) The psp is more interested in graphics than game content.

The PSP version of Chinatown Wars is easier to play, more precise, and visually more outstanding than the Nintendo DS version.

All that being said, the xbox and 360 aren't all that innovative either. They're just game consoles, albeit with a dedicated internet service attached. For innovation in games, you need to look at Nintendo. Windows, though, is something else again. Sure, in the beginning, maybe it started as borrowed concepts, and no, it hasn't always been the stablest system. What it does do, though, is run 90% of the computers in the world well enough to run almost any application. That's everything from high end phones to workstations to high performance systems and servers.

nokia,samsung,"which brand of mobile phone do you think is the best - nokia, motorola, samsung, etc??..?","Well this is not an easy question to answer. Never the less it is a pretty good question and an interesting one too.

Let's analyze. Companies like Samsung, LG etc are basically consumer electronics companies. Their product line ranges from TVs to DVD players on one side and mobile phone to CD/DVD writers on the other. They also assemble PCs and manufacture LCD/Plasma screens. For example, a company like LG focuses most of its attention (and resources) to LCD screens and Plasma TVs as it is a high profit business. For them mobile phone is an instrument to complete their product line.

On the other hand, companies like Nokia and Motorola are pure communication companies. They are the ones that develop new technologies like Bluetooth, MMS etc. Since their core activity (and their means of earning their bread and butter) is wireless communication, their mobile phones will always be most customer friendly. Moreover, their after sales service would also be comparatively better to companies like Samsung, LG etc.

However, the choice of a mobile phone is very personal and individualistic. Therefore, one will have to look at what one needs to buy rather than what the companies want to sell. The above analysis would help him or her to make a wise decision.","[""Well this is not an easy question to answer.

Juniper Networks ( JNPR ) and Motorola Solutions ( MSI ) have better revenue growth characteristics than Nokia in the networking space. But Motorola kept trying to come up with even better products, and its next products weren't any cooler than the Razr, while other makers (including Nokia) soon caught up with cool designs of their own. In the short term, it seems like Motorola+Android worked better than Nokia+Windows Phone, but I'm giving Microsoft the benefit of the doubt as WP7 wasn't supposed to sell anyway. Then yes, Nokia went to set a world record failure in handsets, Nokia fell in the next year, 2011, worse than Motorola or Palm or Siemens or RIM .
I have had Nokia phones for the last 4 years and think their menus are better than Motorola. And the Nokia 6205 sounds even better than the old Motorola that I had. The simple fact is that if Android devices are being returned at such rate, companies like Motorola, HTC etc. would have been in a worse state than Nokia already. My 2002 Nokia 3595 is way better than the C414, as was my Motorola RAZR V3. So yes, Nokia is now falling faster than at its worst moment Palm, Motorola, Siemens, Windows Mobile, Ericsson, Blackberry or any other maker.","I would prefer to use motorola because of quicker, easier for me to hold it and bigger.

First Apple then AMD have proven that Megahertz alone is not a very good way to measure the computers performance.  Apple does not use the Windows operating system.  If you use to Windows then you will find Apple confusing.  It is my belief that the best computer is one which uses an AMD64 processor.  Recent reports are that the AMD is the number one desktop computer sold in the retail market for general home use.  And the best news is that a computer with an AMD processor is generally hundreds of dollars less expensive than one using Intel.  Performance testing in recent years have proved over and over that an AMD powered computer of say 2100 Megahurtz performs as well or in most cases better than an Intel powered computer operating at 3400 Megahertz.']","The ibm is better than dell.

I personally think that Apple's build quality has gone down in the past few years -- they're better than Dell is at the moment, but worse than Lenovo/IBM. IBM ( NYSE: IBM     ) -- perhaps a better fit than Dell as HP's closest rival after Hurd's EDS acquisition -- has treated shareholders to market-thumping gains in that time, but the stock hasn't doubled. Even in less disk-intensive tests, X4150 came out at least 50 percent faster than the Dell unit. bawalker - dude you know IBM has maybe an even negative perception among some but I got this x230 eServer off eBay and I have to say I like it waay better than Compaq/HP or even Dell (but not Sun) .
Dell has done a better job than IBM and cHomPaq in this area. Ultimately, we managed to get a set of numbers off the chassis with two blades running and the remainder of the blades removed, which showed power efficiency to be on par with Dell and better than IBM. Nonetheless, the price is not bad for a Linux-oriented vendor that will likely offer better support to Ubuntu users than Dell.

The nano doesn't scratch any easier than a 5g video from what I've seen. It ends up being a $600 device that is worse than an iPod Nano. I have a much harder time with the 450 than the Nano Or MCPX. Weighing just 0.8 ounces, the nano is super lightweight, making it easier to carry around than an iPhone and lighter to wear than a GPS watch. Nano sizes can be easier to comprehend when people realise a human hair is about 80,000 times bigger than a nano particle, the molecular biologist says.","Looks like a is better, because of safer, greater and faster.

It is a pound lighter than the 16"" Sony F I am using. Like HP and Dell...and a bit cheaper (with much better battery life) than Sony.

Sony has announced the launch of a new 13-inch Sony Vaio laptop, the Sony Vaio Z, that is thinner and lighter than the current Apple Macbook Air, but will cost almost twice the price; £2,699 . It weighs a tad bit more than the Sony Vaio S, and is a lighter than the 13-inch Apple MacBook Pro. Windows laptop companies were also quicker than Apple to adopt all manner of better screen technologies including high resolution displays for other panel sizes (such as 15.4in 1920x1200 displays), LED backlighting and RGB backlighting (which I believe Apple still don't offer).

It's a great back to school offer that's offered for college students and faculty members and though some might not exactly see a free PS3 or PS Vita as an incentive to buy a laptop, it's certainly a better deal than what Apple is offering .

The reason are greater, cheaper and bigger. IBM is capable of performing a tiny bit better than Dell thanks to its custom high performance chipset. I personally think that Apple's build quality has gone down in the past few years -- they're better than Dell is at the moment, but worse than Lenovo/IBM. IBM ( NYSE: IBM     ) -- perhaps a better fit than Dell as HP's closest rival after Hurd's EDS acquisition -- has treated shareholders to market-thumping gains in that time, but the stock hasn't doubled. Even in less disk-intensive tests, X4150 came out at least 50 percent faster than the Dell unit. bawalker - dude you know IBM has maybe an even negative perception among some but I got this x230 eServer off eBay and I have to say I like it waay better than Compaq/HP or even Dell (but not Sun) .
Dell has done a better job than IBM and cHomPaq in this area. Ultimately, we managed to get a set of numbers off the chassis with two blades running and the remainder of the blades removed, which showed power efficiency to be on par with Dell and better than IBM. Nonetheless, the price is not bad for a Linux-oriented vendor that will likely offer better support to Ubuntu users than Dell. Although Dell has a server business, it's lighter than IBM Corp.'s, Haff said. Now, instead of crossing your fingers, you can pay IBM to predict whether or not your data centre will light up faster than a Dell laptop.","After much thought, I realized that  ibm is better, because of greater, cheaper and bigger. But you should know that dell is easier, easier to become an ibm and lighter."

MY NUMBER ONE CHOICE!', ""Let me repost my previous answer and it might help you:  Let me start by enumerating why you should not but these brands: 1.) HP/Compaq - does not have good quality control of parts from supplier like optical drives, TFT's etc. According to a supplier (I can not mention names), he said that he is pissed off with DELL because they reject 40 to 50% of his optical drives due to quality issues but happy with HP because he accepts them with a discount. I have two of this before an Armada M300 & HP Pavillion and sold them both after having so much problems and no help from stupid HP. Don't buy this. Offer this to your enemy. 2.) IBM - which is now LENOVO. I have so many customer complaints about IBM notebooks now. It seems it's not as good as the original thinkpad and getting replacement parts is very difficult. A Lenovo officer informed me that they have so many internal problems because the owners are concentrating on margins rather than customer satisfaction. Remember Lenovo bought IBM PC's & Laptops and they want to get their money back fast.  3.) ACER - This is a clone company trying hard to play in the branded market. This brand has been failing technical testing from large corporate customer. A lot of business establishments does not recognize this brand and wouldn't touch it with a ten foot pole. 4.) Toshiba - This is actually a good brand. Because they only concentrate on the portables. Known for their quality but a lot of times very pricy. Check for the nearest support center and the parts are a little bit hard to get hold of. 5.) Fujitsu - expensive Japanese made notebook but I honestly do not recommend it. 6.) Sony VAIO - Now this brand & model is very good but it's too rich for my blood. It's like buying a Porsche but a regular Ford is already OK for the same job. I had one of this before and I sold it. 7.) DELL - For me this is the best buy and good value for money. I've seen how DELL assembles and test their units and they are so bloody strict. If they find fault in one component they stop the assembly line (liking stopping the presses) remove the ssuspected batch problem and replace it with another batch and they could do that in less than 2 hours and test them again and again. Their back-end or support is fantastic. DELL was the first one who informed the world of the battery problem which they get from Sony. They have the website and replaced the battery fore free. Only after several months later other brands follow and finally admit it. I am so sorry but I started using DELL only May this year and it extremely good. I have torture tested it and never failed on me.

From what I have read in Smart Computing Dell has about the worst tech support and computers ever. Though I can not recall all the stories or names of the people one story does stand out.  A woman bought a Dell laptop for about 900 and left it in her car one night. The computer froze and the screen cracked. Dell said that they would replace the screen for free. So she sent the computer off to Dell. Dell called back and told her that the computer would cost 960 dollars or so to fix. Not replace just fix the screen. The lady wrote Smart Computing and since they have more power than a regular person does and they cleared the issue up for the woman.  This is just one of the many Dell horror stories. Other stories include Dell promising to replace things with new parts only to put refurbished parts in the computer and then the parts burning out shortly after. Dell charging people for things they never bought or charging them for things that were covered under the warranty. The list goes on. Every month there is at least one letter of complaint about Dell in SC and they aren't the only company who consumers have problems with but they do seem to have the worst and most problems.  Personally I wouldn't go with any of the big name computer companies except for Apple. STOP! I know what you are thinking . 'I'm going to go buy an Apple.' Don't just yet. Apple makes a good solid computer BUT if you are not ready for a completely different operating system I do not recommend that you get an Apple. If I were out to buy a laptop I would find a friend who knows his or her computers and then have them help you through the part selection process over at http://www.ibuypower.com. They have a good selection of computers at a very nice price and do not practice those weird gimmicks that places like Dell do where they say you can get the computer for 'as low as xxx' but it turns out to be a good bit more than that because the base parts they use are sub-par technologies.

For machines needing repair, Apple placed better than Dell, HP, IBM, Compaq, Gateway, and Micron (also in order). For instance, I think Apple has a better desktop experience than Ubuntu does, and I also think they have slicker laptops than Dell has.
I happen to think Dell has better products and warranties than Apple products. In review after review Dell monitors look better than Apple in displaying stuff. Windows and well choosed components in a PC superior by far to Apple computers and OSX . It's logistics that make Dell better than Apple. Dell is 1000:1 and Formac is 700:1 - still far better, and way cheaper than Apple monitors.","After much thought, I realized that  apple is better, because of sharper and smarter.

The reason are easier, easier to work on and higher. It seems to me that Chrysler, with most of its eggs in one basket, the U.S., does better profitwise than those global companies such as GM and Toyota. Even if Toyota does not overtake Ford in US sales, Toyota remains a better choice than Ford, especially for people who are not GM or Chrysler fans. This year, sales are flat-which is a pretty good performance compared with deep drops at General Motors (GM), Ford (F), and Chrysler, and better than some other imports, such as Toyota (TM) and BMW (BMWG.DE). If this were GM/Ford/Chrysler I would say chances are you're getting a better product in 2012 than 1992 for similar money but this isn't the Big Three, its the vaunted Toyota. Drivetrain Due to its much higher torque, the engine of the Chrysler 300C does a much better job of transmitting power to the wheels than the Toyota Avalon Hybrid.
There were all sorts of problems including the fact that Chrysler vehicles were inferior to Japanese vehicles, especially the long-lasting Toyota automobiles. , but as a gross oversimplification, I'll say I believe Honda/Acura and Toyota/Lexus cars are designed and built better than cars by the big three (GM, Ford, Chrysler). Toyota projects global profits around $18.8 billion, better than Ford, GM and the Chrysler division of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV combined. I applaud Toyota for being able to pull the wool over so many people's eyes better than For, GM or Chrysler. Although Nissan does not have the reliability record of Honda and Toyota, I have found that their vehicles tend to be better than the Chrysler models... especially as it pertains to durability.","After much thought, I realized that  chrysler is better, because of easier, easier to work on and higher.

google,microsoft,Yahoo or Microsoft or Google?,"Firstly, I think that all three are very good. At the moment my choice would be Yahoo.

Google's great selling point was its search engine with the complex algorithm that tended to produce relevant answers. At one stage that seemed to work well, but lately I find that any question that I ask gets bogged down with commercial sites. 

When I search a topic I don't want to know what the same 40 web retailers want me to know about an iPod or a Pioneer CDJ1000, I want to know stuff that they DON'T want me to know.

Of course this will be tricky for any search engine. Commercial sites will make a business to come top of the pile somehow.

Yahoo's answer to this seems to be to deliver content from people. They are doing this by empowering tools like delicious and my web, through Yahoo answers and Yahoo groups. ""The social internet"" as some people call it.

I think in the long run this will pay dividends.

MSN has exceptional web content properties. Things like WebMD and Encarta deliver great information on many topics without having to trawl through gibberish about collidal silver and jojoba oil. It gets stuck though if you want info on something like a Pioneer CDJ1000, I doubt that MSN will ever have content on that.

Yahoo could really really do with something like Encarta or Wikipedia. That's a gaping hole in its property.

Google seems to have recognised the problems with its model and is trying to make revenue through being an ""always-on"" store of information through things like GMail and storing all your data on a remote server.

I think the privacy isssues to do with this will be resolved eventually and I think it is A Good Thing.

Yahoo are hot on their trail though, as is Microsoft. Their mail services have been upgraded vastly and I think at the moment at least, Yahoo is ahead of GMail.

coca-cola,pepsi,What is better: Coca-Cola or Pepsi?,"Interesting theory, but I have an issue with your Proposed ""experiment"". If you put a metal object in a glass of COKE for 5 days, what in the world would this prove about Coke doing anything to peoples insides??

First..your analogy is poor. People's stomach linings are made of soft tissue, not metal. Therefore, the damage coke can do to metal says ABSOLUTELY NOTHING about what Coke does to Tissues.

Next, Coke probably stays in contact with any area of a persons stomach, intestines, ect for only brief periods of time. You are placing non-moving metal objects in Coke for 5 DAYS!!. Once again, there is no valid comparison.

Perhaps take a peach. Place one half in some sort of mildly acidic solution such as vinegar and water. 

Next, take the other half. Place it in the same solution, mixed with a glass of COKE, Diet Coke..for 1/2 an hour.

Is the Peach in the Coke solution rotted away after 1/2 an hour??? If so, it would lend a hell of a lot more credibility to your theory!!!!

Secondly, Coke is just plain 'evil'. In undergrad, during lunch I've had a soda from the soda machine once in a while. Never had any problems with Pepsi, but once I had to get a Coke (I guess Pepsi was out at that time), I got the soda, went back to my table and gently set it down. A few minutes later, I twisted the cap, and the thing exploded. That's not cool either ! Not at all ! Another time when I bought a Coke, I set it down on the table. A few minutes later, completely by itself, the bottle fell over, breaking the cap, and the thing exploded again. A friend of mine used to work in a store and Pepsi outsold Coke about 6 to 1. She even said that the Pepsi delivery guys are much cooler than the guys from Coke. Moreover, Pepsi's blue is a much better color than Coke's silly red.

Better yet, the Satellite P105-S921 costs hundreds less than the competing Dell XPS M170 and thousands less than the top-of-the-line Dell XPS M1710. This is faster than the 6:22 category average and quicker than the Dell Latitude 6430u (5:11) and Lenovo ThinkPad T431s (5:13).

A woman bought a Dell laptop for about 900 and left it in her car one night. The computer froze and the screen cracked. Dell said that they would replace the screen for free. So she sent the computer off to Dell. Dell called back and told her that the computer would cost 960 dollars or so to fix. Not replace just fix the screen. The lady wrote Smart Computing and since they have more power than a regular person does and they cleared the issue up for the woman.  This is just one of the many Dell horror stories. Other stories include Dell promising to replace things with new parts only to put refurbished parts in the computer and then the parts burning out shortly after. Dell charging people for things they never bought or charging them for things that were covered under the warranty. The list goes on.

Let's analyze. Companies like Samsung, LG etc are basically consumer electronics companies. Their product line ranges from TVs to DVD players on one side and mobile phone to CD/DVD writers on the other. They also assemble PCs and manufacture LCD/Plasma screens. For example, a company like LG focuses most of its attention (and resources) to LCD screens and Plasma TVs as it is a high profit business. For them mobile phone is an instrument to complete their product line.

On the other hand, companies like Nokia and Motorola are pure communication companies. They are the ones that develop new technologies like Bluetooth, MMS etc. Since their core activity (and their means of earning their bread and butter) is wireless communication, their mobile phones will always be most customer friendly. Moreover, their after sales service would also be comparatively better to companies like Samsung, LG etc.

However, the choice of a mobile phone is very personal and individualistic. Therefore, one will have to look at what one needs to buy rather than what the companies want to sell. The above analysis would help him or her to make a wise decision.","[""Well this is not an easy question to answer.

The reason are easier, sharper and easier to pull the razor against your skin. Double-edge razors require a level of involvement and expertise greater than that needed to shave with a cartridge razor, but are much simpler to use than a cut-throat razor. ""This will do a better job than the razor. It's a hell of a lot easier than doing edits with a razor blade. It was a much faster shaving experience than my previous razor. Regardless, I think a simpler and perhaps better (Occam's Razor) explanation is to think about this being actually evolutionarily advantageous, rather than a simple vestigial byproduct.
This highly efficient razor used re-stroppable hollow-ground blades and was dramatically safer than a straight razor. Ripjaws uses his claw-tipped fins and razor-sharp teeth to attack enemies with strength superior to a person. It definitely does a much worse job than my usual Venus razor. SR-91 plastic gives the lenses razor-ship image quality, durability superior to that of polycarbonate, and a weight that's lighter than glass. This one is important, because as Michael said, there is no D/E razor that is quicker or less likely to cut you than a cartridge razor.","I came to the conclusion that a is better, because of easier, sharper and easier to pull the razor against your skin.

Nokia apps appear to be a better value add to WP via Nokia Lumia, than HTC apps for HTC devices, or Samsung apps for Samsung devices, and LG, and so on. Microsoft is almost certainly offering Nokia - which remains the world's biggest handset manufacturer, lest we forget - far better terms than it's offered previous partners such as HTC, Samsung and LG.

motorola,nokia,"which brand of mobile phone do you think is the best - nokia, motorola, samsung, etc??..?","Well this is not an easy question to answer. Never the less it is a pretty good question and an interesting one too.

Let's analyze. Companies like Samsung, LG etc are basically consumer electronics companies. Their product line ranges from TVs to DVD players on one side and mobile phone to CD/DVD writers on the other. They also assemble PCs and manufacture LCD/Plasma screens. For example, a company like LG focuses most of its attention (and resources) to LCD screens and Plasma TVs as it is a high profit business. For them mobile phone is an instrument to complete their product line.

On the other hand, companies like Nokia and Motorola are pure communication companies. They are the ones that develop new technologies like Bluetooth, MMS etc. Since their core activity (and their means of earning their bread and butter) is wireless communication, their mobile phones will always be most customer friendly. Moreover, their after sales service would also be comparatively better to companies like Samsung, LG etc.

However, the choice of a mobile phone is very personal and individualistic. Therefore, one will have to look at what one needs to buy rather than what the companies want to sell. The above analysis would help him or her to make a wise decision.","[""Well this is not an easy question to answer.

php,ruby,"Can someone tell me the major differences between MySQL/PHP, RubyonRails, LAMP, and ASP.net?","PHP/MySQL is often embedded in HTML.  It's fairly easy to learn and there is a lot of free scripts online that you can use on your own web site.  A good way to learn PHP/MySQL is to install a content management system like WordPress and then tweak the code to make it do what you want.  w3schools.com has some PHP tutorials, and also use the search engines to find PHP tutorials.  PHP.net is a good reference also.  For example to find out how to send email with PHP, just type php.net/mail into your browser.  To learn how to format the date, type php.net/date.

LAMP stands for Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP.  They are made to work well together.  You can use a Linux distro on your own computer (like Ubuntu) and test your PHP/MySQL scripts on your own computer.  That is one of the best ways to learn.  Most web sites are hosted on Linux and LAMP is very popular.  Using it at home is a good learning experience.

If you have Windows and want to use PHP/MySQL, download Apache2triad and it will install what you need on your computer.

ASP.NET is for pratical purposes Microsoft-only.  I don't recommend it because it is more expensive.  You would probably need to buy software for it (Visual Studio) and the hosting is more expensive.  There are many more free scripts for PHP/MySQL than for ASP.NET as far as I know. 

RubyOnRails is excellent.  Ruby is easy to learn.  ROR is a bit harder unless you know some programming.  There are a few good books out on Ruby and ROR in the Pragmatic Programmers series.

For e-commerce, why not try Drupal?  It is a free content management system written in PHP/MySQL.  It has ecommerce features.

The BioTouch USB reader with BioLogon 3 connected at least a minute faster than serial-port devices, which sometimes required rebooting twice.
The internal serial cards tend to offer better data transfer rates than the USB to Serial adapters in testing. @ChrisStratton's comment points out another issue: USB devices are an order of magnitude harder to debug than simple UART serial. Not all USB-RS232 adapters are alike, and all of them work much worse than real serial ports what comes to RS232 interfacer handshaking signals. A USB flash drive uses USB, which is generally a slower interface than the Serial ATA interface.

The reason are greater and easier to use. Bluetooth is a protocol that operates on the 2.4 GHz radio band that provides greater range than infrared, but the speeds still aren't that great. [Lightman and Rojas, p. 202-3] Infrared Data Association is extremely inferior to that of Bluetooth. While Wi-Fi was designed as a networking technology and Bluetooth more of a simple cable replacement with a better range than infrared, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi now often compete in terms of which protocol is the most appropriate to use in any given device or application. Bluetooth does make the new glasses easier to use, and they keep sync much better than the old infrared versions. What makes this way cooler than doing an infrared remote signal is the ability to program when/how the camera captures images.
Bluetooth 4.0 has come standard on every iOS device after the iPhone 4S, and aside from using almost no battery, it has much greater range than infrared and doesn't require line as sight. Here's the arm being controlled using Bluetooth, which is significantly harder than infrared (also the claws were crappy when I recorded this): .

Even with that - Microsoft did a whole lot better than IBM. I'm sorry but IBM is possibly a worse choice for buying SUN than Microsoft. That makes Microsoft a better dividend growth stock than IBM. I said that most of the switching to Linux would come from UNIX sellers, which meant that IBM and Sun would be hurt far worse than Microsoft.
That's easier said than done, considering Microsoft Office's dominance over the last few years. The research budgets of IBM or Xerox were undoubtedly much greater annually in the early1980s than they were for Apple or Microsoft. Being a CIO nowadays I truly would like to introduce IBM servers, Tivoli products, Thinkpads and moving to Notes as the communication platform as I find these superior to Microsoft. The software giant put those concerns to rest with better-than-expected sales of Microsoft Vista.

A woman bought a Dell laptop for about 900 and left it in her car one night. The computer froze and the screen cracked. Dell said that they would replace the screen for free. So she sent the computer off to Dell. Dell called back and told her that the computer would cost 960 dollars or so to fix. Not replace just fix the screen. The lady wrote Smart Computing and since they have more power than a regular person does and they cleared the issue up for the woman.  This is just one of the many Dell horror stories.

apple,sony,Who can brag the best monitor quality--Apple or Sony?,"The question is wrong. 

Apple does not have other technics in its monitors. They use always TFT from Sony inside.

The sticker on it is Apple. Inside the monitor is Sony's system.
Apple itself does produce monitors with some modifications.

But generally Sony's TFT (Thin Film Transistor) system that exist now already many years was a revolution for the quality of monitors and is used by all Monitor factories around the world.

See Sony Ericsson, Motorola, LG... They have their own designs and some of these are better than Apple. The Sony Ericsson Xperia ray has better specifications than the Apple iPhone 3GS .
So ironic that Microsoft and Apple get the better Sony apps than the Sony products do. I'd say Apple has a better relationship with the merged SonyEriccson than Sony itself.

Great all-around system, especially if you're into RPGs. Has the biggest library of games available

XBOX/XBOX 360:
Another good all-around system. Arguably the best in graphics although that doesn't necessarily mean the games themselves are better. Game library, especially for 360 platform is relatively small and more expensive. Decent selection of sports and racing games, very weak on RPGs

Microsoft claims, and my tests bear out, that Windows 7 makes networking computers much simpler, quicker and more reliable than XP does. Windows 7 is faster and better looking than windows Vista and XP operating system. New builds of Windows 7 boot faster than XP, and run smoother with fewer hiccups. Its alot lighter than Windows Vista and its performance is better than Windows XP; so things have improved.
You mean that the more secure Windows 2003 Server is worse for having more ports open than Windows XP Home!!! OSX gets faster with each release - can't say that for Windows except partly with Windows 7 (faster than Vista, but slower than XP). The implication is that 7 is slower than XP, which a lot of people seem to be commenting on here. I've always felt that Windows Vista was considerably slower than XP, in my experience 7 is somewhat faster than Vista. From what I hear, XP still boots faster and runs lighter than windows 7.","I came to the conclusion that windows is better, because of safer, quicker and lighter.

You're probably right that the plastic ones for 4x5 are lighter than wood. The plastic tray is less likely to leak and easier to clean than wood. I guess wood is harder than plastic.","Looks like wood is better, because of faster, cheaper and warmer. But it will be useful for you to know that plastic is stronger, easier to handle and easier to clean."
baseball,softball,Whats so different between baseball and softball and how are they similar?,"Well...This is what I found:

The ball is always pitched underarm while in baseball the ball is released in any position, usually overarm or sidearm.

The ball is larger, softer and less dense than a baseball.

The playing field is a lot smaller than a baseball field.

There is fast pitch and slow pitch.

The size of the ball varies according to the classification of play; the permitted circumferences in international play are 12 in (30 cm) and 11 in ( 28 cm).

In softball pitches are underhand. Men and women do play together and when they do, men hit a different sized ball than women (the womens' ball is smaller). Different leagues I've played in have different rules. I played in one league that had a line drawn with chalk dividing the outfield. Players couldn't cross that line when a woman was at bat until she had hit the ball. The lineup for coed play has to alternate men and women. If a man walks with two outs then the woman up next has the option to walk also, so the man gets to walk to second. My womens' team has played in tournaments all over the place and one year in the state we got rained out on Saturday and had to go to a one-pitch format for Sunday.

baseball,softball,What do you think is better...softball or baseball?,"Depends on what aspect and type of softball your referring to. 

Slowpitch softball is alright, although it's pretty much a hitter's game and the most intriguing question is who's going to buy the beer aftewards.

Fastpitch softball is a fantastic game, particulary in regards to the different types of pitches.  The only complaint I have, particularly once you get into the higher levels (women's college world series, for example), is that the games are so low scoring.  You get to see the best pitchers dominate the best hitters, but a 1-0 game with 18 Ks by one pitcher is tough to swallow night after night.  I also wish there were a few more extra base hits - it seems that if it's not a slap single, it's a HR.  Plus I get confused with the switching rules of when a player can go and re-enter.

Baseball seems to be the more complex of the two, particularly when you look at the specialization in certain areas, particularly pitching.  There seems to be a bit more going on throughout the game as far as strategy, but the same could be said for softball.

baseball,softball,What is the Difference between softball and baseball??,"Softball like baseball is played by men and women. There are two types of softball, fast pitch and slow pitch. Four main differences between soft ball and baseball are that the ball is larger in the game of softball,the ball is pitched underhand, the bases are situated closer together and the pitching mound is considerably closer to the batter.

While slow pitch softball is more a leisurely recreational game with much activity because the ball is pitched slow with a required arc  and scoring is usually frequent, fast pitch softball is more a pitcher oriented low scoring game. Even the best of batters in fastball have difficulty hitting. Batting against top notch pitchers in fast pitch soft ball is not for the faint of heart. The ball comes from the mound which is only 40-46 feet away, and at speeds upwards of 80 mph. Soft ball games are usually only 7 innings long and in top competitive games it is not unusual for pitchers to attain 12 -15 strikeouts. 
Believe me, some of the best MLB players would have difficulty looking good at the plate in elite player fastball (softball) games, whether it is a man or a woman pitching.","['Softball like baseball is played by men and women.

With the swift overshadowing of the GameCube by the superior Xbox and PlayStation 2, Nintendo's Wii may well be the company's last chance to shift its software focus away from teeny tiny knee-high players. The IGN, GameSpot, and GameSpy reviews noted the GameCube version features superior graphics, substantially faster loading times, and more responsive controls than the PlayStation 2 version, resulting in lower scores for the latter. You will notice that the PS1 and PS2 sold worse in their first 4 months than the Xbox, Gamecube, Dreamcast and N64.
Similarly, the PS2 fared better in the marketplace than the technically superior Xbox and GameCube (which was primarily hampered by storage space issues like the N64 before it). Even with its limited gameplay features (in comparison to the sequels), the original MGS is a hell of a lot better than that other GameCube bullshit. Better than being able to play your GBA on a Gamecube better than a DS or WIi and it is actually HD. I based my point on the fact that no developer in their right mind wold stay on a console that is probably inferior to other alternatives (as we learned from Wii and Gamecube).

concrete,wood,What are the pros and cons of using wooden ties vs. concrete ties?,"Wood ties are the standard choice... Hardwoods, treated with creosote, they have an extended service lives. They can be layed and used anywhere, individually -- since the spikes are simply pounded in, the wood ties can be used in a switch or anywhere without modification. They are however more prone to rot, damage, and even fire when oil soaked from locomotives.

Concrete ties are becoming more numerous. They are more rigid than wood, and are not prone to rot, and are pre-treated for expansion/contraction like the welded rail they hold. They are associated with higher speed trackage due to not needing the upkeep of wood. One con of concrete would be the hardware associated with hold the rail -- special ties are required for specific locations and uses, unlike wood.

bread,pizza,How is pizza dough different from bread dough?,"pizza dough is a simpler dough, only proofs (or rises) once, while most breads require 2 proofs, but have more in the way of texture and flavor.","['pizza dough is a simpler dough, only proofs (or rises) once, while most breads require 2 proofs, but have more in the way of texture and flavor.', 'pizza dough is a simpler dough, only proofs (or rises) once, while most breads require 2 proofs, but have more in the way of texture and flavor.', ""Pizza Dough Recipe  There has been a clamor for years to get me to post a pizza recipe. So here it is. A few tips: Always use bread flour, which has more protein. If you don't have a pizza stone, cook the pizza on a preheated cookie sheet. This will make it brown much better. Have you ingredients at room temperature, at least the ones that won't spoil. And consider precooking the meats. This pizza cooks about ten minutes. Cold toppings may not cook well. This recipe will make two medium pizzas. Sponge: 3/4 cup warm water 1 tsp sugar 1/4 oz active fry yeast 1 tsp flour 1/2 tsp salt 2 tbsp olive oil 3 cups bread flour Sauce: 4 oz tomato sauce 2 oz tomato paste 1 tsp garlic powder 1 tsp oregano 1/2 tsp salt 1/2 tsp sugar  Mix together the sponge ingredients (first four ingredients). The water should be warm but not hot. Let that stand for 5 minutes or so. Then add the olive oil and salt.  From this point forward the goal is to use as little flour as possible.  Start mixing in flour 1/2 cup at a time, mixing well between each addition. You probably won't get past the 1 1/2 cup point before the mixture gets too think to mix in more flour, but this will vary. Just keep adding flour slowly and mixing until the dough gets to the point where you can get your hands into it and form it into a ball. The dough should still be rather sticky, but not gooey.  Turn the dough ball out onto a well floured cutting board or counter and start kneading. The kneading works like this: Press your fingers into the center of the dough ball, grab the front of the dough ball and pull it over the top of the depression you just made, press down hard with the heal of you palm, turn the dough ball 1/4 turn and repeat. The idea is to keep stretching and compressing the dough.  Try and do this very quickly. As the dough feels like it might stick, spread a small amount of flour on the surface you're using. If the dough does stick enough to get on the board or your hands you'll need to remove it. Scrape the board with a knife and rub your hands together to remove any stuck dough.  You'll need to add flour a lot, and you want to use as little flour as possible, so try to dust the surface lightly. Keep kneading for about 10-15 minutes. It will get harder to work with after about 5 minutes, but keep at it. Longer kneading will incorporate too much flour, and less won't develop the glutton enough.  Cut the dough ball in half and form each half into a smooth ball by folding the edges into the bottom. Lightly oil two bowls and place a ball in each. Lightly coat the dough balls with oil, cover loosely with plastic wrap, and place both bowls in the back of the fridge. If you want to use the dough ASAP you can let the dough rise out on the counter for two hours rather than putting it in the fridge. But it won't have the same taste and it will be harder to form the pizza.  Let the dough rise in the fridge for several hours or overnight. About 1-2 hours before you're going to top the pizza, take the dough out and let it warm up and rise more. Don't touch the dough yet or punch it down. It should triple or more in size. Preheat the oven to 450 well before you're ready to use it. If you have a pizza stone it will take longer to heat that up completely. If you don't have a pizza stone you can preheat a cookie sheet instead.  Prepare all your ingredients and toppings before you touch the dough. The pizza will have to come together very quickly and you won't have time to chop or mix things. Make the sauce, but don't cook it, just mix the ingredients together. Lay out the meats, chop the veggies, grate the cheese, etc. Get your pizza peel ready by rubbing it with plenty of flour. If you don't have a pizza peel you can use a cookie sheet without a lip, or even a piece of cardboard.  When you're ready to make the pizza, take the dough ball out and pu"", 'wow i cant beleive people really take time to type and answer, long as a novel.........', 'http://home.centurytel.net/cmptj/pizza/QA.htm', 'pizza dough dont have as much yeast as bread and is not as full of flavors']","The bread is better than pizza.

More stable, easier USB connectivity, better driver support for newer hardware, program compatibility (e.g. such as iTunes, Google Earth, newer releases of Folding at Home), automated security routines, power management (though not entirely perfect), tablet PC version if you have such a beast (like my laptop!), built-in CPU idler for lower temperatures / better battery life / less noise.

XP Cons:
Sheer hardware demand! Bare install on the laptop was about 10gb - I can get 98SE into about 100mb, and I doubt even with pre-install bloatware it'd have been over 300-400. CPU load can be crazy at times, and don't talk to me about how much memory it uses.
Default window scheme looks like an explosion in a toy factory and is even slower. Likes to hide away important ""advanced"" functions behind a glaze of tweeness - basically treats you like an idiot toddler who can't be trusted. Conversely it tries to do far too much stuff automatically as well (tons of ""services"" and other things happening by themselves even when you don't want them to).
Product needs to be actively registered to be used (""activated"") and sometimes this has to be repeated when you change certain bits of hardware.
No MSDOS layer any more, even as an emergency boot option. Does allegedly enhance stability, but has e.g. caused a friend no end of headaches because they can't get at the disc ""raw"" to replace a corrupt system file.
Those bleeding notification baloons on the task bar will drive you insane.
Various stuff like that...

To put it another way:

Win98 Pros:
Very sleek and slick operating system in comparison, appears to do much the same in about a quarter of the hardware (windows 95 is even more efficient, if you need ultimate work-per-cpu-cycle performance). Memory management isn't the greatest, but it works beautifully if you put 512mb in (which is about XP's minimum tolerance level)... it'll never touch the swapfile so who cares if there's the odd leak? Also takes up little CPU time unneccessarily and can be installed in a very small space. Simple window themes don't use much resource.
Nice and simple, and with a couple clicks in a couple of easily found menus can be brought down to almost fully-manual operation. The computer does what you tell it and nothing else.
Still works with USB, albeit with installation of drivers.
Still works a-ok with 95% of programs and hardware (there's not many things you need to do today you didn't eight years ago!).
Cheap or free to get hold of with no activation needed (it's two generations behind)
All problems well known and can be dealt with by established programs. No built in firewall or antivirus, antispy etc, but these can be got easily and for free most of the time. Nothing much new will be cropping up as virus / spyware writers have moved on to XP.
Still has MSDOS for when you need it (recovery, BIOS update, .... and old games!)
Built-in hard disc checking and tidying programs are actually BETTER!

Win98 cons:
Limited or functionality with some new hardware and software. Particularly some USB devices...
No built-in CPU idler - can be hard on the chip (and your ears, electric bill) unless you load one in specifically.
Can be kinda unstable if you're not careful with drivers and shareware programs... unless you're a saint it'll need a reinstall at least once every 5 years.
Bit ugly for some people!

basketball,volleyball,which do you thinks is better??volleyball or basketball???i like volley but they say that they get paid low?,"Sister, you might have directed this to the guys but I'm compelled to answer anyway.  Look, serious players start fairly young (usually Middle School age for BB and VB).  They play on their school teams and they also play club.  Volleyball club players generally pay in excess of $3K/year in fees, plus more to go to the Nationals (Junior Olympics).  It can be expensive to develop any talent.  Sports are no exception.  Instead of thinking about things way in the future, you need to just decide which sport is best for you and go after it with a passion.

I am a volleyball coach and have taken on many ""projects"" in the past.  That is, people with talent but no skills or experience.  Find a club in your area and see if they'll talk to you about the sport.  Here's a place to start:

http://www.usavolleyball.org/Juniors/

The coaches have seen a lot of players.  Like BB, very few people become professionals.  Do it because it's fun and because you LIKE TO WIN!  If you have the right athleticism and attitude you might make a team.  Don't stop with your first try-out.  Many teams are looking for specific positions.  Study the sport first and understand the roles of each position and which position you might like to play.  When you try-out, tell the coach which position(s) you're interested in.  If they already have a lot of depth in the position you're after, then go try out for another team, and don't take a rejection personally.

Just FYI, many women have had to make a choice between BB and VB.  In particular I'm thinking of Kristin Folkl , who attended Stanford and played both sports.  And she played them well.  Really well.  Olympic well.  Maybe it would be helpful for you to do a Google or Dogpile search on her and study the pros and cons of each sport from her perspective.  Who knows, maybe if you send her fan mail, she'll give you some advice!","['Sister, you might have directed this to the guys but I\'m compelled to answer anyway.

football,golf,don't you know the difference between football and golf?,"Golf (gowf in Scots) is a game where individual players or teams hit a ball into a hole using various clubs, and is one of the few ball games that does not use a fixed standard playing area. It is defined in the Rules of Golf as ""playing a ball with a club from the teeing ground into the hole by a stroke or successive strokes in accordance with the Rules.""

Golf originated in Scotland and has been played for at least five centuries in the British Isles. The oldest course in the world is The Old Links at Musselburgh. Golf, in essentially the form we know it today, has been played on Scotland's Musselburgh Links since 1672, and earlier versions of the game have been played in the British Isles and the low-countries of Northern Europe for several centuries before that. Although often viewed as an elite pastime, golf is an increasingly popular sport that can be played for one's entire life.

American football, known in the United States and Canada [1] simply as football, is a competitive team sport. The object of the game is to advance the football towards the opposing team's end zone and score points. The ball can be advanced by carrying the ball, or by throwing or handing it from one teammate to the other. Points can be scored in a variety of ways, including carrying the ball over the goal line, throwing the ball to another player past the goal line or kicking it through the goal posts on the opposing side. The winner is the team with the most points when the time expires and the last play ends.

Outside of the United States and Canada, the sport is usually referred to as American football (or sometimes as gridiron or gridiron football) to differentiate it from other football games, especially association football (soccer) and rugby football. American football evolved as a separate sport from rugby football in the late 19th century. Arena football is a variant of American football. Canadian football is a close relative to the sport with a few key differences; the word ""football"" in Canada can mean American football or Canadian football depending on context.

Association football, soccer, or simply football is a team sport played between two teams consisting of eleven players each. It is a ball game played on a rectangular grass field with a goal at each end. The object of the game is to score by maneuvering the ball into the opposing goal. Other than the goalkeepers, players may not use their hands or arms to propel the ball in general play. The winner of the match is the team that has scored most goals at the end of the match. The sport is known by many names throughout the English-speaking world, although football is the most common. Other names, such as association football and soccer, are often used to distinguish the game from other codes of football, since the word football may be used to refer to several quite different games.

The origins of football are thought to be over 2000 years old. Indeed, in 2004, football's governing body Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) officially acknowledged that China was the birthplace of football, when people played the sport of cuju around 200 BC.

The object of the game is to advance the football towards the opposing team's end zone and score points. The ball can be advanced by carrying the ball, or by throwing or handing it from one teammate to the other. Points can be scored in a variety of ways, including carrying the ball over the goal line, throwing the ball to another player past the goal line or kicking it through the goal posts on the opposing side. The winner is the team with the most points when the time expires and the last play ends. Outside of the United States and Canada, the sport is usually referred to as American football (or sometimes as gridiron or gridiron football) to differentiate it from other football games, especially association football (soccer) and rugby football. American football evolved as a separate sport from rugby football in the late 19th century. Arena football is a variant of American football. Canadian football is a close relative to the sport with a few key differences; the word 'football' in Canada can mean American football or Canadian football depending on context. Association football, soccer, or simply football is a team sport played between two teams consisting of eleven players each. It is a ball game played on a rectangular grass field with a goal at each end. The object of the game is to score by maneuvering the ball into the opposing goal. Other than the goalkeepers, players may not use their hands or arms to propel the ball in general play. The winner of the match is the team that has scored most goals at the end of the match. The sport is known by many names throughout the English-speaking world, although football is the most common. Other names, such as association football and soccer, are often used to distinguish the game from other codes of football, since the word football may be used to refer to several quite different games. The origins of football are thought to be over 2000 years old. Indeed, in 2004, football's governing body Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) officially acknowledged that China was the birthplace of football, when people played the sport of cuju around 200 BC. Association football in paticular dervived out of games played at public schools in England in the Nineteenth Century."", ""yes....it's very obvious."", 'dang STJC u gave a whole report lol...y dont u jus make it simple: golf is boring and football is more energetic and has waayy more cuter and muscular guyz', 'Ya I know wat u mean a gut answered a football question: Wao is the best QB in the NFL and the guy said Tager Woods']","The football is better than golf.

ps3,wii,PS3 AND NINTENDO Wii which one is the best console?,PS3 will be way better.,"['PS3 will be way better.', ""The Wii of course.  Just the controller alone makes it better. It has built in motion sensor and a speaker. Can you turn the PS3 controller into a sword to fight with in first person? No. Can you turn is sideways and use it as a steering wheel? No. Can you use multiple controllers at once? No. Not to even mention playing the drums with them. Then there's the hardware. Built in parental controls, and downloadable games reaching all the way back to the original NES games. And with a price tag of $250 compared to a price tag of $600? $250. No shit."", 'PS3 will be as a computer, so it will be much better', ""ps3 becasue nintendo wii is some japanese bull and i can't imagine it will be good' Get out. You need to get yourself informed and stop being racist, Sony is a Japanese company too. 'Why? Because Nintendo has only childish games and PSx has games for all ages, you can run games from PS1 into PS2 and I believe it will be the same for the PS3. PSx have many games, more than Nintendo or even XBox.' Are you kidding me? What was your first console, the PS? Nintendo goes back more than ten years before the first PlayStation, you have no idea what the hell you're talking about. Also, you can download a crapload of games from the Genesis, Turbo Grafx, NES, SNES, N64, and play GCN games aside from Wii games. I don't think you know what those systems are considering that you think Sony has more games on their systems than a company that has been making game consoles 10 years before Sony. Nintendo loses in all its consoles because it's kiddy? There must have been a crapload of kids back in 1985 and 1990 because Nintendo won those times. And Nintendo only has games for kids? I guess RE4 was for kids right? And so is Red Steel, Twilight Princess, and Metroid Prime 3? Get out. The PS3 is a better system if you only count hardware. But it doesn't matter how powerful the system is, if it's hard to develop for, more expensive to develop for, and is at an outrageous price for a video game console, then it will get less developer support, which means less games, and not as many high quality games. I'm not saying that the PS3 won't have great games, it has FF XIII, Metal Gear Solid 4, and others, but how long will it last? And also notice how the big games for PS3 are mostly sequels, Final Fantasy THIRTEEN, Metal Gear Solid FOUR, etc. When you want to make a great game on a system as complicated as the PS3, you're taking a big gamble. Your project will take very long, most likely a year or two, and you'll be using a lot of resources. No matter how great the game is, if it doesn't sell well, you'll be losing A LOT of money. That stops a lot of developers from taking big risks on new franchises, and stops small developers from making potentially amazing games, so the industry gets a lot of sequals, rehashes, and spin offs. When there are too many of those, people get tired of those sequals, and potential gamers that haven't played before don't buy games because they would have to play the other games in a series to enjoy the game. Nintendo is heading the right way with their next console, the Wii. Their console is very easy to develop for, because a weaker console is easier to develop for, while a powerful console is extremely difficult and time consuming. That gives developers a chance to make new, original games, and even if it doesn't turn out to be a big success, little to no money will be lost on the project. Because of the price of the Wii, it will be more accessable to consumers, which means more people will buy a Wii, and combined with how easy it is, more developers will make more games, and new games for the Wii. Nintendo just needs to bring up a great launch, and they'll have many developers making outstanding games in the following years."", ""NINTENDO WII it's got a cool control (shaped like a tv remote) and the control has motion sensors. so lets say youre fighting darth vador. your controller is your lightsaber. aaannnddd, you can download every game ever made for nintendo (even NES!) on it, and some select from Sega and Atari.  and there's an optional joystick you can attach to the bluetooth controller."", 'PS3 hands down.', ""PSx vs. Nintendo, well, Nintendo loses in all of it's consoles.

I see some people saying that the controller for Nintendo is better, but if you're a hardcore gamer like me, you know that the controller is not what we're going to look at. You can get used to a one button controller, even, if the game is good."", 'The best console depends on what you want from it. For party consoles, the Wii will be better, as it has more controllers, and it will depend more on your skill that button-bashing. Eg Smash brothers mario kart etc. However the PS3 will probably have more famous games eg GTA4, as Sony buys the rights to the brands.

Nintendo's premise for a new system is simply a gimmick. You wave a wand around and play games on a system that will be far inferior to the other next-gen consoles. Once the novelty of a new controller (which I hear  Sony is developing something similar) wears off, I think its going to turn into a cheap, kids-only console. Technically, Sony beat out everyone with flashy graphics, but then let alot of people down when they announced the price and the cheaper, less-features version. However, the XBox 360 shipped out without HDDVD support (supposedly an add-on for a later date) and a lot of lackluster games. Most reviews say there is very little difference between the XBox games and the 360 games, other than a few graphical enhancements.

While Wii U is superior to Xbox and PS3, developers and gamers alike are concerned that the console is more 'last' generation not 'next'. The Wii-U still has graphical power greater than the PS3 and 360. The new Wii, meanwhile, is rumored to be technologically superior to the 360 and PS3.
Nintendo had a few other controllers they were thinking of using instead, some looked worse than the original PS3 one. It's also been explained many times that it would cost Nintendo more money to use tech inferior to whats in 360/PS3 at this point. Although the graphics are inferior to the powerfull PS3 and 360, the Wii is still able to ""shove out"" titles like TP, SMG, SSBB, MP3, all of which had very reasonable visual glory.

Xbox 360 2. PS3 3. Wii I have never really been a fan of the Wii because of the controller.  Flame me later.  I have loved all of the other Nintendos, got the Gamecube and enjoyed it.  Then they came out with the GBA and then they started locking certain parts of games, for example Tingle of Windwaker, or the sticky bomb of Splinter Cell.  Just something, and they did it to sell GBAs.  I hated that, and have not gotten over it.  Now, the mature games come out for Xbox and Playstation while the Gamecube gets mostly Pokemon and Madden Football.  I know it got Resident Evil, but that isn't enough.  I think the Wii will be fun to play, and I am really stoked about the new Zelda game, though I will probably get it for Gamecube.  I am just afraid that the controller will be a gimmick, or that they will make you use it for stupid stuff.  Red Steel looks awesome to play, don't get me wrong, but I won't want to flail my arms around for a couple of hours just to play a game.  However, on a positive note, the idea to play old games is awesome.  Mario 64 and Pilotwings 64, oh how I long for thee. Playstation 1 was an awesome system, the Playstation 2 was not an awesome system.  It had good games, but the system is no good.  2 Controller ports?  Come on.  That was sooo Super Nintendo.  Playstation 3 should be a good system.  Though it looks like they didn't spend much time with it.  The motion sensing controller?  Can't put a rumble feature on it because it will interfere with the motion sensing feature?  Nintendo didn't seem to have a problem with it.  I like the idea of Blu-Ray though.  I think I would rather have that standard win the movie war.  Though they are going to be outrageous for the discs, and the way that they offer movies now, they won't even put the extra space over HD-DVD to use unless you purchase a way more expensive Special Edition of the movie.  I liked how movies were priced about 9 months ago.  They all came with special features and you could get them at a Wal-mart first week they were out for $15.  Now for special features they are like $22-30.  1080p I bet is awesome.  If you have the $600 Playstation 3 (Need HDMI for 1080p, Component only goes up to 1080i) and a new expensive tv for the 1080p input.  Yes, some tv's output in 1080p, but most do not have a direct 1080p input, they achieve that through upconverting 1080i signals.  However, they are offering a robust line up of games, and free online play.  And I am sure the system will be a beast On the case of the 360.  Yes I do own one of these.  And before I get blasted, there is no rule that says I can only pick 1 system forever.  If the PS3 looks to be a great system I can pick it up, along with the Wii.  It does me no good to pick only one system.  The Xbox made some major ground last time around.  This allowed for several things.  First, game companies can now see that if they make games for more than 1 system, they can make more money, so that means that the PS3 will lose some of its more exclusive titles.  Nintendo will get it's Nintendo brand games, but just about everything else for Nintendo is for every other system.  The 360 is more affordable that the PS3, but probably more expensive than the Wii.  The optional HD-DVD is I think a good thing.  If HD-DVD loses the movie war, I don't have to buy it and waste money.  If it wins the war, I can pick up a cheaper next gen movie player.  If Blu-Ray loses, well then..that's just not good for PS3 people, but if they win, sweet deal on the cheap Blu-Ray.  However, you have to pay for online play, and they had a bumpy start on their launch.  My first one messed up, I was without one for almost 2 weeks.  And then I got another one and I am back in business.  The cool stuff about the 360 is stuff that isn't even out yet.  Since Microsoft owns the PC market, and just about everything that goes along with it, they can work on everything being n"", ""1. Wii 2. PS3 3. Xbox-360 I believe that the Nintendo Wii will be the best since it will use new innovated technology like the motion-sensing and controller feedback while keeping the cost of the console down unlike Sony's PS3. But the PS3 will be able to read Blu-Ray disc while Xbox-360 can't read HD-DVD unless you buy an external drive for it which will cost a little more. Most people predict that the Nintendo Wii might cost $199, the same price of every Nintendo's home console launch price.""]","The why is b than better.

ps3,wii,Do I buy the Wii or the PS3 for my husband?,"It sounds like your husband is a Nintendo fan based on his systems so far. He will definitely enjoy the franchises Nintendo has to offer, especially the new Zelda being released with the console. Thats the closest thing Nintendo has to an RPG so far but there's good news. Square Enix, the people responsible for those Final Fantasy games had an exclusive deal with Sony for the last generation of systems which does not apply for this generation. So expect RPGs in the future for the Wii. If your kids like shooters, there is no better system than the Wii. Where you point the remote is where you shoot. Nintendo recently has been focusing on getting non-gamers involved. The Wii has channels you can browse that display the weather, the news, a place to store and view photos/home movies from a digital camera (The memory is an SD card just like in digital cameras.) and even a message board where you can leave your sons or husband a message for the next time he turns on the console. It also has a feature known as virtual console where for $5, $8, or $10 he can put some of his old favorite Nintendo, Nintendo Famicon, Nintendo 64, and Sega games on his Wii.

       If Nintendo follows the same trend they have for the new gameboy, Nintendo DS, it's about giving you innovative games at an affordable price. People have posted earlier about the Wii costing more in the long run. Let's break that down. First you have the Wii at $250 for a system. The PS3 will retail for $500-600 depending on if you want the full package or not. Right off the bat, the PS3 is $250 more than the Wii in the best case scenario. Games are what you buy the most of for a system, and the Wii has the cheaper price for their games at $50. Compare that to PS3's $60 per game and that $250 more you spent on the PS3 increases by $10 for every game you buy. As for the controllers, a full Wii controller costs $60 and a PS3 $50. 1 comes with each console so you will only need to buy 3 at the most. The only other cost in the systems are for memory. As I mentioned earlier it uses SD cards and I highly doubt you can manage to fill $250+ worth of SD memory it would take to make the Wii ""Cost more in the long run.""

Wii MotionPlus purports to track players' movements in finer detail and with greater accuracy than the Wii hardware alone. In fact, the video of Xenoblade looked inferior to the Wii release.

First off, the Nintendo game systems have been far behind that of microsoft and playstation from the very beginning.  Graphics and games are too cartunistic.  Xbox360 I will agree is a great game console.  I have played many of the games for it and yeah they are really good.  Gears of war is an okay game. I mean it has okay graphics, but overall I feel it is overrated.  The ps3 will becoming out with blu ray capabilities.  Blu ray will soon replace dvd's, as high definition.  Which is like dvd's on crack.  It will be the cheapest blu ray player for quite some time.  You will be able to play ps, ps2, and psp games on it.  Games will never go bad on the ps3.  The new games are going to be expensive but this is because there will be 10 layers of enamel on the game.  Which makes it practically impossible to scratch.  I believe these features alone makes the system at least half a generation better than xbox360 and the Wii.  It will have internet capabilities built in.  What this whole battle basically comes out to is games.  If your into halo, I am, halo 3 is enough of a reason for people to buy it.

So at the same price PS3 is a superior game machine comparing with XBOX360. The touch-screen interface makes it easier to use than the XBox360 controller to do anything advanced.
Since the Wii's graphics capabilities are inferior to PS3 and Xbox360, the cartoony Lego-videogame look seems to suit it better. Yet games looked worse on Wii U than XBox360 or ps3 in some games. I was surprised to find that the graphics are inferior to the xbox360 version, which I spent a lot of time playing. Installing the gamepad is you business and could be harder than using a xbox360 pad, but I hear its easy too.

ps3,wii,"what is the best of the 3 game units, 360, ps3 or wii?","In all honesty each system has its own merits to consider. I believe there is no ""best"" overall, just best for personal tastes. 

360: Has more games available for next-gen and has been market tested being out for over a year now. Graphics are very good and the controls are decent (always liked the more trigger like buttons then they have on ps2/ps3). Content wise is more suited to mature gamers with exceptions such as Viva Pinata, and the children's games like Cars and Open Season. Tag on a genre to the system, those who like shooters and sports will be more open to the Xbox 360 then the others. 

PS3: This system boasts high end graphics like the 360 but fall short in some aspects. While it does support a higher resolution then the 360 can with HD and a built-in HDMI connection, the 360 is getting a patch in a time to support the higher 1080p/i. Though in honesty no system looks the best when it launches so cannot be easily compared to the 360 till the PS3 has had at least a year of development. They stuck with same basic design as the PS2's Dual Shock controllers though they removed the vibration to add there own motion control dubbed ""Sixaxis"".(To my, and many other gamers disappointment). With built in Blue-Ray technology it allows for high-def movies out of the box and comes cheaper then a standard on the market Blue-Ray player. Though many people think Blue-Ray will go the way of UMD movies (its too early to tell till it becomes a more prominent media) the bright side is since the system is default with the player, all PS3 disks can contain much greater data sizes compared to a standard DVD that the 360 uses. If you placed a genre to the PS3 it would be medium, focusing on sports but adding alot of action adventure and RPG's that the 360 lacks (or at least will within the year of the systems launch.)

Wii: Nintendo's new system is hard to compare to the other two. PS3 and 360 are much more graphic intensive, boasting true Next-Generation graphics. They are powerful high tech equipment that can rival some super computers. The Wii on the other hand uses more current and past technology, such as utilizing the Gamecube's basic tech and upgrading it slightly. The graphics, while cant compare to the other two are good in there own right. What sets the Wii apart is its next-gen game play. The Wiimote and the nunchuck attachment are fully motion sensitive, and while they only have 3 axis compared to the PS3's 6 axis, the Wii is gonna use much more motion since most games will be designed around it. Nintendo made the system so that doing other gaming types, such as playing baseball, shooting a gun, swinging a sword, driving a car, feels more natural then previous ""button mashing"" games have been in the past. With only a few buttons on either controller, most games will be free-form in terms of control. Also the Wii is the only 100% true backwards compatible next-gen system. it can play every gamecube title, and has 4 gamecube controller ports, 2 GC memory ports. It can use all accessories minus 3: Gameboy Player, Modem Adapter, Broadband adapter. But it does come default with a built in wireless network (similar to the DS's wifi). It comes with the least memory then the ps3 or 360 with only 512megs of internal flash memory but has an expandable SD flash memory stick port on the front. (Though nintendo game saves never were too large). Also the Wii will boast the Virtual Console, the ability to download NES, SNES, N64, Sega Genesis, and TurboGraph 16x games, with 30 titles of Virtual console games available at launch and more to come that's pretty decent, though it will cost $5 to $10 to download per game based on its platform. Also N64 downloaded games will not feature rumble support. To rate the genre of the Wii its more of an everyone system.

Yes, the 360 and PS3 have nice graphics but what is the point of good looks if underneath you are essentially playing the same old, same old...
The 360 and PS3 just follow on from their predecessors, but with more power and better graphics. You are still playing the same games, in the same way... only now you are playing them with better visuals...

Great!

The Nintendo Wii offers a totally different way of gaming, putting you more in control - what you do is interpreted on screen.

People criticize the machine for having less power than Xbox or PS3 but of all the screenshots and video footage released so far, the graphical capability is just as good as those machines. The difference is in the controls, and that is where the Wii stands out. 
You will play Xbox and PS3 with the standard control pads but the Wii has sensor pads which are one step away from virtual reality - you move the pad, your character moves - easy as that!

As for release dates and prices, well, not sure where you are but this is the situation in the UK:

Xbox360 is already released, and sells at roughly £250-280 depending on whether it is bundled with a game or not.

Nintendo Wii is released on the 8th December and is priced at £179. It comes with a free multiplayer game called Wii Sports.

The PS3 is expected to be released March 2007 at a staggering price of £430!

So, as regards to your Son's Christmas present, it looks like a contest between the 360 and the Wii.

The 360 sold horribly in Japan where people were mostly waiting for Sony to get its console out. Sony has made it easier to acess their disc technology (Blu-ray) by packaging it with the console. 360 owners will have to buy an attachment for HD-DVD. The Wii deserves to be left out of that clash of the titans. It wants nothing to do with the markets Microsoft and Sony are going after and will do very well as an independent console. My predictions in 5 years: Everybody will own a Wii (at $250, why not?) and the 360 will be dead with Blu-Ray reigning as the new VCR.', ""Definately the Wii.  XBox 360 and PS3 are way too expensive, have no good games that are exclusive to the system, and are innovative for all the wrong reasons (I mean, come on, unless you've got the money for an HDTV, what's the point of Bluray?  Which by the way is not a very established format).  The Wii has new game control, sweet games like 'Twilight Princess' and 'Red Steel,' and goes for only $250 a pop.  Oh, and did I mention that Wii is the only system that's completely backwards-compatable (you can play all the Game Cube games on it)?

The reason are greater, cheaper and longer. But at least I was to get a new one from Nintendo alot easier than getting my 360 fixed. The Wii-U still has graphical power greater than the PS3 and 360. Some of the late-life GC games look better than PS3 and 360 launch titles. This is the First Time Nintendo has 3rd party developers making good games with better graphics than 360 and ps3. That means it had a better launch month than either the PS3 or the 360 worldwide.
Although the graphics are inferior to the powerfull PS3 and 360, the Wii is still able to ""shove out"" titles like TP, SMG, SSBB, MP3, all of which had very reasonable visual glory. The graphics are rendered through the GPU, and the GPU is not only faster, but more memory than either the 360 or the ps3. The graphics are equal to or worse than the Xbox 360/PS3, consoles that have been out for more than five years. The only reason why the Tekken and Warriors 3 developers are having trouble is due to slower clock speed and because they're trying to develop for it like it's the 360.

It's just a little extra if you want it to match your room or something like that. The 360 is also more internet based, so if you like to play online games, the 360 would be the consol for you. ^^

I havent' played the Wii yet but from what I've heard, it's pretty fun because of the fact it's motion sensored. Makes you get up and literally ""play"" your game. It's also a good value, only 250 dollars. The graphics are pretty good too.  

The Ps3 is a powerful system also, I think it may be up there with the 360 graphics-wise. I've seen some game previews that were on the PS3 and they were awesome. I couldn't tell the difference between GC movies and the in-game graphics. haha. 

What I suggest is to get the consol that goes with your gaming style. If you enjoy online gaming and shooters, then a 360 is for you. Nintendo has always catered to the younger crowds and their games have always been adventure-based, like Zelda and Mario for example.

Well consider this: Nintendo has been, currently is, and always will be the king when it comes to ease of use and fairly simple straight forwardness. All of Nintendos games and systems are fairly straight forward and usually have the fewest buttons and controls. Thier games are also some of the best as far as playability, so you can catch on fairly quickly. And a cool thing is that with the Wii's motion sensor capabilites they are goign to be brinign back some of the older games like Duck Hunt, and they will even give you a gun albeit a little revamped but thats still gonna be cool. The Sony has always been known for its RPG's, that is role-playing games. Games like Final Fantasy and .Hack which are very long very drawn out games involving multiple discs. And Sony is getting even better moving to Blu-Ray with the PS3 which means they will be able to put even longer more involved games on thier discs increasing the play time you have. Now the X-Box systems are the newest and least tested of the platforms. So far we've seen games like Halo 2 and GuitarHero exclusivly with the X-Box 360 and these games have procurred a cult following very fast. X-Box 360 has arguably some of the best graphics of a system out-to-date as it is most like a computer, and therefore can run better graphics. But I can assure you that the X-Box 360 is just the beginning of the new generation of systems. So the best system all depends on what you are looking for in the game. For old school games with fairly easy playability go with the Wii and at $250 you wont break the bank, but you might not get anythign outstanding either. For extended play time and indepth plots that will have you playing for days and even weeks go with the PS3 and at $600 you might need to wait for the price to drop some or buy it on E-Bay xD. Or for stunnign graphics and popular games go with the 360 but since there are two versions that means two prices so $300 - $400 not terribly exoensive but none to cheap either.

Even Nintendo's worst selling console, the Gamecube, had a much better library of software than the Wii did. It's just another good example of why I still like the GameCube better than the Wii. What is worrying, though, is the fact that the Wii U is bombing harder than the Gamecube and the N64, and that its circumstances are significantly worse. I question whether they'd ignore the Wii U library in the future if this home console flounders worse than the Gamecube did.

ps3,wii,"Whats game system is better for all around Entertainment PS3, XBox360, or The Wii.?","Well, I've asked this question many times before .. and after a couple of months of reading reviews, messages boards and the systems tech info .. in MY opinion, 1. XBOX360, 2. Wii and 3 PS3.
Why I say this .. in the hardware department, the 360 vs. PS3 are basically the same, with some going with a the better architecture for the 360 and others (but few in comparison) to the PS3. But again, basically they are the same. One difference would be the integrated Blue Ray DVD that is already included on the PS3. But, at least for me, that doesn't make any difference, I really just don't care for Blue-Ray DVDs. XBOX360 has an ADD-ON Blue Ray DVD thingy, which you can get for around 200$ (I think), so it's basically the same price. 
The Wii is a fairly simple console, with the ""fun factor"" to the max, but seriously left behind on the hardware race (graphics and such).
I, personally after pondering this question, decided to get a 360, just because I wanted to get the best console and best price. The Wii, in my opinion, is a great console, but I decided NOT to buy one when I saw the 250$ price tag (I really think that the price should have been 149.99 - 199.99 no more than that). 

So, overall, for me the best console for entertainment (because of the hardware+fun factor+price) is the 360.

But if you have the money buy an Xbox360 + a Wii .. OR a PS3 + Wii. Only this way you might get the best of both sides of gaming .. kick ass graphics and incredible fun.","['Well, I\'ve asked this question many times before .. and after a couple of months of reading reviews, messages boards and the systems tech info .. in MY opinion, 1.

I'd have to say the Nintendo Wii. Mostly because Xbox 360 and PS3 are just an improvement on sound and graphics. The Wii is a whole new ballgame, a wireless controller that is motion sensetive.

EA has claimed that it is harder to port games to the PS3 because of the Blu-ray technology. They stated that it will take a lot longer to port Crysis to the PS3 from the PC.

Just like the last-gen games, no one showed the true power of the Xbox until Ubisoft unleashed Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory. The Wii is a good system and is totally worth $250, but doesn't have that many great games for anyone over the age of 13. I do suggest getting the Xbox 360 it is the superior system, and latter on when the Wii may have some games actually worth playing, buy one. I think its kind of like the difference between Plasma and LCD. Sure the Plasmas(PS3) look better(not much better), but they also don't last as long and have a better chance of getting a picture burnt in on the screen. While the LCDs(Xbox 360) are cheaper, look great, have a less chance of burn-in, and are slightly more compact. The LCD's have more bang for your buck. P.S.

It may be $600, but that isn't much for what you're getting. You should only get a PS3 if you are a HARDCORE gamer, meaning you live for gaming. With a 60GB harddrive, any operating system (Like Mac OS X) can be installed on it. It's internet connection is amazing. With a cable modem, the pages load on the internet browser with a blink of an eye. As for the internet service, don't be fooled, it is GREAT. XBox Live is amazing, but it is NOT free. To connect to the internet, JUST TO PLAY ONLINE GAMES, costs money, a flat rate. Check that out http://www.xbox.com/en-us/live/default.htm there. The Playstation Network Platform has many features. For one, it's free to browse and play games. Like any online service, it costs $$$ to download add-ins (like more levels) to games, or to download a game to your large 60GB hard drive. With Playstation Network Platform, you can have a video conversation with any friend from around the world, for free! Playstation one games can be downloaded from PlayStartion Network Platform, and played from the large 60GB hard drive, or downloaded to your psp for some protable fun, for a low price. When XBox Live is free, let me know. ;-). The Playstation 3's processor the Cell Broadband Engine, the mastermind of the entire system, has 8 cores, or 8 separate processors inside of it, to process multiple tasks, like heavy rain showers, with each droplet having it's own characteristics, or the spike grenades in Resistance: Fall of Man, (40 of them) all have their own dynamics. Not even the XBos 360 can do this. The processor in the XBox 360 has only 3 cores, which can leave it to process about 15 of the spikes in the grenade, with a light rainshower in the background, with no wind affecting either the spikes' movement, or the raindrops', unlike the PlayStation 3. The processor is also much fatser, due to the 8 cores. The faster you can think, the more things you can think about, and that makes you smarter. In addition to this, other, smaller, less powerful processors can be found throughout the system, and imbedded in the motherboard, which are specialized in certain aspects of a game, such as physics, shading, and coloring. With no physics, your snowflakes would drop to the ground straight down even with a 100mph gust of wind. Your snowflakes would all be identical. Without shading, darkness of the shadows would be completely dull. Without coloring, well, you know how your picture would look. Then there's the addition of the Blu-Ray disc. The Blu-Ray disc is a 1080p High Definition capable CD, that can hold 25GB of information, in the Playstation 3's case. This leads to longer games, and better looking games, with amazing physics. The XBox 360 can handle an HD-DVD disc, which, while awesome in it's own right, can hold 16GB. This disc is also 1080p high definition capable. The Playstation 3 can handle up to 7 wireless bluetooth controllers, each with motion sensing capability. They can detect the angle that the controller is in. While not comparable to the amazing 'Wii-mote' it is certaintly better than the clunky XBox 360 remote.  The XBox 360 does not have motion sensing capability, and while it does have a vibration function, the controller signals in some controllers drops when the battery gets to 20% full. The Playstation 3's controller uses an ND system, which is a power system in which the controllers capabilities do no fade away, even when there is only 1% of bettery life left. In addition, the XBox 360 store, to its credit, is now offering TV shows. I'm just sitting around waiting for them to give us a 60GB drive to store them in. My local radio station reported today, that an independent study group, claims that 300,000 XBox 360 systems have gotten free manufacturer's defect repairs. My old XBox completely failed on me, scratching all of my discs, and Microsoft wrote back saying tha"", 'ps3', 'ps3 all the way', 'i really think that the PS3 is better bc of the graphics when u play it on a some sort of a high def. xbox 360 is almost as good as the ps3. the wii is i think ok.', ""If you have a lot a friends and family,love to be entertain, and cash is your MAIN priority then get the wii because it's only 250 but if you are obssed with graphics and is some kind of spectacle nerd get the ps3 or xbox 360.

Most of the 360's problems have been fixed. It's been over a year, which means most problems that occur have been reported, and MS has fixed it. So, if you buy a 360, don't expect to have a lot of problems. 2. This time around, the 360 is getting more games than the XBX because of more 3rd party support, and it's been out for over a year, so many 3rd parties have had plenty of time to get to know the 360 architecture. 3. MS is easier to program for than the PS3, so 3rd party that don't have a talented staff might make games for the 360 instead of the PS3. 4. MS can't make a dent in the Japanese market, so Japanese developers may not develop games for the 360, so a lot of the games that you know may not appear on the 360. 5. DVD-9 might not be enough space for developers, so they may stay around from the 360. Games are getting bigger and bigger, more and more realistic, so it's going to require a lot of space. Blue Dragon is rumored to take up 3 DVD-9. That would fit in one Blu-ray. Less profit if it takes up more than 1 disk since the price is still 59.99. 6. XBL is still the premiere online service. 7. PS3 will have plenty of issues because it's the launch, and most launch consoles have problems. As the problems get reported, Sony will fix it, and the next wave of PS3 should have less problems than the launch wave. 8. It's still debatable over which console will have the most games. Most 3rd party games will appear on both consoles, so it's going to be up to the 1st and 2nd parties to make the difference. 9. Some of the bigger franchises are still picking PS3 for it's time exclusivity. It is rumored that Rockstar (Grand Theft Auto 4) and Ubisoft (Assassin's Creed) offered Sony a chance to lock them up for the first 6 months, but Sony was slow to act, so now those franchises are appearing on both systems at the same time. 10. PS3's online is free, but it's probably not going to be anywhere near as good as XBL. Don't listen to the guy above about PS3 not working on regular TV. PS3 will work on regular TV. I should know.

With graphics that will compete (though they are weaker) with the PS3 and an already impressive game line-up and an HD enhancement on the way, not to mention XBox Live, which is the best online support for a system thus far, the 360 is a strong, yet far underrated competitor.  The price, though high, is still less than the PS3, and with most of the hardware glitches worked out by now, it will be a much sturdier bet for the price.

          And now to the wii.  The line-up at launch is to say the least incredible.  There are games such as red steel and Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess for hard-core gamers,the ""kiddie games"" for the lil' tykes, and other titles that meet in the middle.  With full motion sensitivity, the wii is a true innovation to gaming.  The design is compact (about the size of three DVD cases stacked atop one another) and it will fit in tight spaces thanks to the slot loading device.  Though it is somewhat prone to breaking the wii is reinforced with steel plating on the inside(thus it is three DVD cases, not two).  Now we come to the all-important price tag.  At $250 the wii is by far the cheapest system, and with a game included, is the only system that is bundled with one.  Once you spend alot of money on the console, how much are you going to want to spend on games?  Unlike the other systems, Nintendo has guarnteed that all first party(games produced by Nintendo) will not cost more then $50 before taxes, though second and third party titles are at the discretion of the producing company.  

          Seeing all this, you might be able to make your decision more easily.  Though the 360 and PS3 have more power, the wii will be cheaper now and later, and will is more innovative.

There are games such as red steel and Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess for hard-core gamers,the 'kiddie games' for the lil' tykes, and other titles that meet in the middle.  With full motion sensitivity, the wii is a true innovation to gaming.  The design is compact (about the size of three DVD cases stacked atop one another) and it will fit in tight spaces thanks to the slot loading device.  Though it is somewhat prone to breaking the wii is reinforced with steel plating on the inside(thus it is three DVD cases, not two).  Now we come to the all-important price tag.  At $250 the wii is by far the cheapest system, and with a game included, is the only system that is bundled with one.  Once you spend alot of money on the console, how much are you going to want to spend on games?  Unlike the other systems, Nintendo has guarnteed that all first party(games produced by Nintendo) will not cost more then $50 before taxes, though second and third party titles are at the discretion of the producing company.             Seeing all this, you might be able to make your decision more easily.  Though the 360 and PS3 have more power, the wii will be cheaper now and later, and will is more innovative.  It is a breath of fresh air that the stagnant gaming industry needs."", ""I'm loyal to the Nintendo brand because it's the first console I ever played. Therefore, I choose the Wii."", ""All three of the systems have their strong and weak points, but I think the Wii is the best overall.  Of course the rarphics don't campare to the xbox 360 or the PS3 with it's blue-ray DVD player, but they are getting better and with a price tag of $250, it is a lot cheaper than the other two.  Also, with its innovative new controller with motion sensors is just plain awesome! Many of the games are great and I'm especially looking forward to the new Zelda game.  Many people refer to Nintendo games as kiddie games, but why is that such a bad thing? Many of the games are great anyways.  The Wii will also have online capability and downloadable games of past Nintendo games. The PS3 is nice, but many won't want to dig that deep into their pockets and pay the price tag of $600. It really has some sweet graphics but with only 400,000(maybe even less) available at launch, and many Sony fans out there, it's pretty unlikely you'll get one this year.  Nintendo has 1 million ready so there's more of a chance to get the Wii.  The PS3 also has problems already since they recently found out that it doens't support some of the older Playstation games. Overall, if you're willing to pay for the PS3 it will be worth it.  The 360 had a nice quality but not many of the games interest me.  The Wii really thought of everything with the new controller, downloadable classics, a sleek design, and great launch titles.  This is juct my opinion, but I think the Wii is by far the best"", 'i love the wii  you can find out what people think at my site www.funzone98.piczo.com and got the funtalk page and post your comments on  ps3 xbox 360 and nintendo wii and read what other people think', ""according to what you said, don't buy the xbox 360, one game isn't everything Wii has good gameplay PS3 has good multimedia I'd go with gameplay, that's why it's called a videoGAME and the Wii is cheapest"", ""The Xbox 360 is anything but ancient, its the best of the three systems.  Xbox Live is better than ever, great games, awesome graphics, comfortable controller, and most of the bugs have been worked out. The PS3 isn't worth $300 much less $600, at E3 the system had tons of problems, including that the controller didn't live up to the hype and the system would overheat in less than 4 hours.  It had many problems and I doubt if all the bugs were worked out in 6 months.  Plus when the 360 had its overheating problems(for consoles made only in 2005) Bill Gates paid for the repairs out of his own pocket, when Sony had problems with the PS2, Sony said pay up or get another console.  And the Wii is worth $350, so the $250 price tag is a steal. Gears of War VS. Resistance VS. Red Steel=Xbox 360 $400 VS. $600 VS. $250=$250(Nintendo Wii) HD-DVD VS. Blu-Ray VS. None=HD DVD(Xbox 360) Processing Power=PS3 Accessories=Xbox 360 Halo 3 VS. Killzone 2 VS. Zelda: TP=Halo 3(Xbox 360) Controller=Nintendo Wii Xbox Live VS. PS3 Online VS.

The Wii is all about the controller and old school games.  And the 360 has power and great games and online play on it's side."", 'Dont get the 360, that things sucks. Its very expensive, The Playstation 3 my couisin just got he put it down on the table followed all the instructions to put it togther and it never worked. I just bought a Wii yesterday and it is excellent and for its low price of 250 (In America) But its great. I reccommend it if you are going to  get one. Good Luck!', ""ps3- Many people are saying that this is the best console that there is going to be... Me I say not. The ps2 did not have many good games that were only for the ps2, and many of the ports were better for the other two systems. Unless you are a high-definition freak with $600 to throw away than it serves no purpose to you. Only reason for the high price is their stupid blue-Ray dvd drives, I don't know about anybody else but if I buy a game system, I'm going to use it to play games, not dvds. X360- The older of the next gen. Would have been a better marketing strategy for them to release halo 3 around the same time as the release of the Wii and ps3, but anyway... This is the better system if you are a high def freak, that actually likes good games even if the graphics are a tad worse than the ps3. Possibly better online system, but this has not been proven yet. Wii- My favorite of the three, mainly because I'm biased because I've been a Nintendo fan for a while. Revolutionary game play with the new WiiMote. Although from what I read its not as good as PC with FPS, it still looks great. For the not so high def freak, that prefers standard Nintendo quality video games such as Zelda, Mario, and SSBB."", ""You moron, hopefully your husband didn't tell you that or else your husband is completely retarded. The xbox games ARE compatabile with the 360 you just need the harddrive(and xbl account for the update) smarty pants. If you were a gamer you would know that. There are certain games that aren't, but microsoft is expanding the list at all times. And with this melting this, that's such bullshit. You can buy an intercooler from gamestop, it happens to computers as well. If Microsoft would have just put in more fans in the system there would be no problem, and I bet Sony will have the same problem. The 360 has good game selection there's going to be halo 3, halo wars, there's gears of war, cod3, vegas, etc. No one can ever look aside of halo. I will always stick with the 360 just because the game selection fits to me and then the wii because it's fun. But the ps3 just doesn't appeal to me, gta already went to the 360 so that covers me. That's the only thing I liked on it. It's too overpriced for no reason other than a shitty dvd player in it and everyone's getting ripped off on it. Then Nintendo's coming in and also ripping you off for $250 since the other prices are up so much just because they can. Yep."", '360 last, later wii, first ps3.', ""My husband and Son (the son is 16) say that the PS3 will outshine the 360 AND Wii. My husband thinks the XBOX was a piece of garbage, from the get-go. They, both, are gamers and my husband is in the Computer Industry. (NOT gaming end, tech end) They both agree that the PS2 graphics are higher quality and that the PS3 will, most likely, be as good........probably better. The only draw-back, to the PS3 will be cost. Also, the XBOX games are NOT compatible with the 360. This means that you spent upwards of $60, per game, for games you now find are useless. The PS2 games will be compatible with the PS3, thus making the $60+ for the games worth the cost of the new unit. Their favorite games are 'Halo','Samurai Warriors' and 'Silent Hill'."", ""Wii for sure. Xbox 360 is laughable... it still overheats unless you have it sitting in the fridge. Plus the game selection is meh.  PS3 is way overpriced. Sony may have shot themselves in the foot... plus it's going to be hard to get one anyway due to under-manufacturing, and on top of that, Sony has rushed it out in order to be able to get the most out of Black Friday (busiest shopping day of the year), so I expect issues and bugs. However, Playstation has always had phenomenal support in terms of games.  Wii is classic Nintendo goodness. Decently priced, and it's launching with ass-kicking games (Zelda & Red Steel for example). Great new controller that everyone is curious about, and did I mention Zelda? Oh and yeah, and Zelda is a launch game! Zelda is good. Zelda is great. I want my Wii!"", ""I believe I answered a question very similar to this yesterday.  I am going to sum it up by telling you the ps3.  The nintendo yes...way too many kiddy games.  XBox360..i own one..but will still be buying a ps3.  I want the ps3 more than i ever wanted the xbox360..yes i love the halo.  But when you have games like grandtheftauto metal gear solid need for speed.  Also..rainbox6:vegas is also coming out for ps3.  The fact that ps3 has bluray is a hugeee deal.  ITs hd-dvd.  It is, will be, and will continue to be the cheapest blu-ray player for quite some time. The ps3 will destroy ps2..you can play all games from ps1, ps2 on the ps3.  I heard you can even play psp games on it.  To sum it up..ps3 hands down. C'mon people. Be serious."", 'PS3 all the way!! Im going to wait in line for this buy. I think this should be a hot seller due to the long 4 year wait, but also the new rendering bodies and tons of new featured games. The Nintendo i believe is going to be reaching a much younger crowd with games and graphics. Either way both systems are going to be new and improved from other systems on the market. The PS3 should he a hot seller. The size of the hardware is due to size increase in everything, fans, memory, processors. I think it should kick the ps2 to the curb. check out gamespot and goto ps3 videos. You will be blown away with the rendering capabilities. Way too cool.', ""U are retarded.

ps3,wii,"What is the best gaming system ever PS3, XBOX360, or NINTENDO WII?","The best of anything is a matter of opinion, so here's mine:

The Wii is designed for a different kind of gamer than the X-Box 360 and the PS3.  As someone who works in electronics, and as a gamer, I see them in two different categories.  When I first approached the question of which was the best, I decided to first compare the 360 to the PS3.

- When you break down the numbers, Xbox 360 has probably more performance than PS3. But both systems pack a lot of power for high definition games and entertainment.

- The Xbox 360 is a clear winner for graphics. The GPU is more powerful. It has more powerful fillrate, and far more pixel and vertex processing horsepower. The 360 also has a clever new way rendering high definition anti aliased back buffers.

- Because the X-Box 360 was released a full year before the PS3, almost all multi-platform developers have made the 360 their primary platform due to timing of release-to-market, this means the games will look and perform better on the 360. The PS3 versions will be ports of the 360 versions. The 360 is also far faster to develop for due to better development tools, better documentation, and easier architecture (3 general purpose CPU’s vs. 8 specialized processors that require DMA).

- The Xbox 360 offers HD-DVD as an add-on for $150. The PS3 comes with one built in (Blu-Ray). The X-Box 360 wins because the DVD player is a separate unit. Playing movies is very taxing on the DVD reader. In a few years, when your PS3 DVD drive goes out due to playing lots of movies (PS2 was notoriously bad about this), you will have to go buy another PS3. With the X-Box 306, you'll just need to replace your HD-DVD player.

After concluding that the 360 is a clear winner over the PS3 (over-priced, over-hyped and under-produced), it was time to decide between it and the Wii.  I'm a big Nintendo fan, being that the Nintendo was my first console ever.  I loved the Mario Bros, and have fond childhood memories of that and Duck Hunt. :)  I also really like the interactive aspect of the Wii, the ability to download and play games from all the previous consoles, and the fact that it only costs $249.  If I wanted a HD DVD player, I'd buy one.  But I was in the market for a gaming console.  So I choose the Wii.

I love the Wii.  I have NFS Carbon and Madden for it.  Both are so awesome.  The playability is rediculous.  The only cons that I have to list:
- I had a sore shoulder for a couple days from trying to hit homeruns after playing Tennis for a couple hours on the Wii-Sports that came with the system.
- Twice I've noticed I was sucking at Carbon only to realize it was almost 4am.  Oops.

Sony tends to market primarily to teens (and wannabe teens) who only like the first person blood-and-guts games. Sony systems also have been known to have bugs in the system at the initial release; Nintendo’s never done that. Further more, Nintendo’s wisely chosen to have made many more Wii systems than Sony has chosen to make PS3 systems; this will cause minimal to no fights and chaos when the Wii comes out unlike what’s all over the news as the PS3’s release.

But if we're just looking at Christmas sales, it's really hard to tell.  And don't forget that the Wii also comes with the classic controller, which is a normal controller (a mix of the SNES controller and the N64 controller is what it looks like to me).

Then I grab the wii, and move it to the next position. ~~~ This will load the dvi and the dvi is moved to the b position. ~~~ It takes about 5 minutes for the dvii to load, but the speed is not as fast as I would like. ~~~ If you have a decent wii, you can move the dvii","The wii is b than 360,ps3. The reason are cheaper. Look at the new star wars, it will have 5 extra levels on the Wii version to make up for its graphically superior sister on 360/ps3 ... . Contarary to early reports based on raw clock frequency, the Wii U RAM actually faster than the 360/PS3 in real world performance. The Wii U's disc read speed is much faster than the 360 & PS3. I hear Tekken Tag Tournament 2 is quite good on Wii U, and that Ninja Gaiden 3 is a much more better game than the 360/PS3 version (due to gameplay reworking, not technology). However, even that scenario turns out to be true, the Wii U version would still be better than 360/PS3.
The argument you're trying to make here is like saying 360/PS3 only had ""slightly"" better third-party support than the Wii. The Wii/PS2 version is significantly harder and/or more time consuming than the 360/PS3 version as you can only attack the Egg Devil Ray after he attacks you then lowers his shield. How can the Wii U be slower than the 360/ps3 with their ancient GPUs. It's also been explained many times that it would cost Nintendo more money to use tech inferior to whats in 360/PS3 at this point. Until you can quantitatively give data or statistics that SHOW the graphics are worse than the 360/PS3, you have absolutely no grounds claiming on such dubious logic.","smth wrong in answer generation, please try again"

Although the Wii does not have the graphical muscle, it does have a revolutionary way to play the games with the new remote scheme. Although the PS3 also has this to some extent; only two axis, as opposed to the Wii which has full 360 degree axis. Many people say that Sony got wind of this and tried to copy it at the very last second. Also, it takes great games to make any game system fly. Nintendo has a great reputation for pumping out these games (Super Mario series, Zelda series) and also has awsome third-party support. And even better, the Wii is backward compatible with all the GameCube titles currently published. PS3 does not support this because of it's Blue-Ray technology. Some might say that they are buying the game system and getting Blue-Ray DVD player for free, but this isn't so. The Blue-Ray DVD system is the reason why the price is so high. It makes up about 80% of the price. And good luck finding Blue-Ray DVDs out there, they are so scarce that it's not even worth it. So in the end, Wii wins hands down. Can't wait to get my hands on one."", 'for me ps3 is more better because of tghe nice specs......', ""I would lean toward the Wii, also because: 1. It looks like the better value.

It does include a Blu-Ray player (Blu-Ray is a fancy new kind of disc), however it's not even guaranteed that Blu-Ray will catch on (Sony is the company really pushing it) as it is competing with HD-DVD. Many developers are staying clear of developing games for PS3 due to its high development costs and low supply. For example, Electronic Arts, an extremely large game developer, has decided to dedicate 40% of its efforts to Wii, 40% of its efforts to XBOX 360, and 20% of its efforts to PS3. Many hardcore gamers will choose PS3, however, due to its more mature content library. It's more of a digital media device or computer than a gaming console. XBOX 360 is a successful console, and definitely the best for online play with its XBOX Live network. It has a very diverse library of games available, and it will continue to have some great games for a while. Its graphics are advanced as well. An add-on is now available that plays HD-DVDs, which analysts estimate will slightly overtake Blu-Ray discs to become the popular disc format in the future. The Nintendo Wii is an entirely different ballgame. It's the least expensive of the consoles, at $250. It's also the least powerful graphics-wise. What it lacks in graphics, it makes up for in gameplay. It introduces an entirely new way of playing games - the controller has fancy motion-sensors built in as well as a pointing device. With this, instead of pressing buttons like you would with a traditional controller, you swing the controller like a tennis racket, slash it like a sword, swoosh it through the air like a football pass, or hold its sides and steer it like a steering wheel. With its Virtual Console feature, you can download over 20 years of classic games from NES, SNES, N64, Sega Genesis, and TurboGrafx consoles. Many developers have flocked to Wii due to its new and unique capabilities, as well as its popularity. Like the 360, the Wii will have a very large number of games being released for a long while as well. In the end, its truly up to you to decide which one is better. The PS3's graphics look excellent, but from first-hand experience I can say that the Wii is more enjoyable to play. After using the Wii's motion controls, playing games on regular controllers with buttons feels unnatural."", ""At this time, I'm tempted to say the Xbox 360, for the following reasons: 1) it's considerably cheaper, 2) there's a better selection of games, and 3) my present understanding is that graphics on the PS3 are only marginally better. Then again, the PS3 hasn't come out yet, so perhaps this opinion is somewhat premature.  As for the Wii, I can't really comment, as I know very little about it besides the fact that it's going to be very small (about the size of three DVD cases stacked together), and it will make extensive use of motion detecting controllers."", ""Since technical info has already been said, I'll just add my personal opinion here, plus a few things i've read. Both X360 and PS3 are only focusing on improving graphics. All games are the same as PS2 and XBOX games, the oly difference being the graphics. Now: You may consider that wonderfull, I personally don't. Wii not only will revolution gameplay with its new controller, but also all the games are innovative and unique. Lot of big companies are working on exlusive titles for wii, plus some titles that were being developed for PS3 were cancelled. On the other hand X360 is not doing very well with sales.

Although it doesn't really matter because no game needs more than 5gb. The HD-DVD, the one Microsoft supports, stores ~25gb, which no game or movie even needs near the amount to be able to be stored. So you're just wasting cash on the PS3 blu-ray crap. As for the graphics card, PS3 has one slightly better than the Xbox 360 but that would be expected because it came out a year later.

ps3,wii,"What should i get the PS3 , xbox 360 or the nintendo Wii ?","This has been said SO MANY TIMES..

No offense but this should either be sticked on top of the question or you should use the damn search option at the top. Now.. Time for my suggestion.

I would rather get the 360, however that's me. So for you.

Depends which kind of gaming you want, wether it be shooting, action, zelda, racing.. etc etc But mainly what divides up the consoles in terms of game is that the age group of the games. The Wii gives you a whole new experience of gaming with the motion controller yet the games are either for family or for kids round the ages of 12, but it's a great FAMILY console. The Xbox is more for older kids around 13 and above, its like a Dad and Son console or just, Son. The PS3 is like the Xbox mixed with the Wii, but it involves more teen games like the Jak Series and Ratchet and Clank, etc etc etc its MAINLY for 13 and above, but those above 18 would most likely enjoy Xbox due to its shooting games like GRAW and Gears of War.
The Wii or the PS3 has a STRONG line up or library of games as the Xbox 360 due to releasing just now, the Xbox 360 has Oblivion, Halo, etc etc and the game of the year GoW. Lot of games to choose from where as the Wii have Zelda, Wii Sports, Madden, Raymond, etc etc etc, not as much choices as the 360 but they're very good games with a whole new experience. The PS3 I would have to say in my opinion has weaker games then the Wii or the 360, but it also depends on what kind of games your looking for, Resistance: Fall of Man is a must have for the PS3 however it seems like the only good game for the PS3 thats currently released, but for both the 360, Wii, and the PS3 more great titles are soon to be released like Halo 3, Call of Duty 3.. Etc..

Now for the secondary entertainment. Game consoles now days arent just for gaming, it allows you to play DVDs, HD support, and music. Etc etc The Wii doesn't support DVD or HD, yet from what I'm hearing the graphics are good nonetheless however it can play other Nintendo games such as the Game Cube games, but I think the motion sensing and the family GAMING makes up for the lack of DVD or movie. The Xbox can play normal DVDs and HDDVD (with an add-on about 200USD -HDDVD-), and it you can connect to your PC if you have Windows Media XP, so basically it comes with a 20GB drive (sold separately unless bought with Premium) which you can upload photos, music, videos, etc etc, and it supports HD. The PS3 is the most powerful console in terms of power out of all of these, it supports HD but from what I'm hearing it has no auto detection so if you play on a HDTV and want to your friends house which has a normal TV you wont be able to play it on the normal TV, it also has the Blu-Ray disc which maybe popular next year or so but I'm fine with the HD DVD, it can also do the same thing as the Xbox in terms of hooking up with the PC and uploading music from Ipods, videos, photos, etc etc. The PS3 also comes standard with the 20GB for the 499USD and a 60GB for 599USD.

Multiplayer is important too, a way for gamers to talk and bash each others brain out with that chain-saw... So... The Wii. I'm not sure about the Wii having multiplayer capabilitys, but I'm sure it does, but along with the multiplayer, you can also go on WiiConnect to download old school games such as Sonic, Mario.. Etc and customize your own avatar or 3D person you use to talk and socialize with others in the Wii World. 
The PS3 is kind of the same but it as more of a powerful multiplayer capability such as Resistance: Fall of Man can have a death match with 40 players, now thats a lot of players to kill and a lot of chances to die, I'm not sure about the PS3 downloading things and such...

The Xbox 360 has the most powerful online capability tho, you can basically talk and chat using a headset, a webcam online and form clans and teams, it also has multiplayer Co-Op version for Gears of War. It also allows you to download movie"", 'i like the Wii........its just different from the other games...the controller that is....i cant wait to get one!!!!', ""This has been said SO MANY TIMES.. No offense but this should either be sticked on top of the question or you should use the damn search option at the top. Now.. Time for my suggestion. I would rather get the 360, however that's me. So for you. Depends which kind of gaming you want, wether it be shooting, action, zelda, racing.. etc etc But mainly what divides up the consoles in terms of game is that the age group of the games. The Wii gives you a whole new experience of gaming with the motion controller yet the games are either for family or for kids round the ages of 12, but it's a great FAMILY console. The Xbox is more for older kids around 13 and above, its like a Dad and Son console or just, Son. The PS3 is like the Xbox mixed with the Wii, but it involves more teen games like the Jak Series and Ratchet and Clank, etc etc etc its MAINLY for 13 and above, but those above 18 would most likely enjoy Xbox due to its shooting games like GRAW and Gears of War. The Wii or the PS3 has a STRONG line up or library of games as the Xbox 360 due to releasing just now, the Xbox 360 has Oblivion, Halo, etc etc and the game of the year GoW. Lot of games to choose from where as the Wii have Zelda, Wii Sports, Madden, Raymond, etc etc etc, not as much choices as the 360 but they're very good games with a whole new experience. The PS3 I would have to say in my opinion has weaker games then the Wii or the 360, but it also depends on what kind of games your looking for, Resistance: Fall of Man is a must have for the PS3 however it seems like the only good game for the PS3 thats currently released, but for both the 360, Wii, and the PS3 more great titles are soon to be released like Halo 3, Call of Duty 3.. Etc.. Now for the secondary entertainment. Game consoles now days arent just for gaming, it allows you to play DVDs, HD support, and music. Etc etc The Wii doesn't support DVD or HD, yet from what I'm hearing the graphics are good nonetheless however it can play other Nintendo games such as the Game Cube games, but I think the motion sensing and the family GAMING makes up for the lack of DVD or movie. The Xbox can play normal DVDs and HDDVD (with an add-on about 200USD -HDDVD-), and it you can connect to your PC if you have Windows Media XP, so basically it comes with a 20GB drive (sold separately unless bought with Premium) which you can upload photos, music, videos, etc etc, and it supports HD. The PS3 is the most powerful console in terms of power out of all of these, it supports HD but from what I'm hearing it has no auto detection so if you play on a HDTV and want to your friends house which has a normal TV you wont be able to play it on the normal TV, it also has the Blu-Ray disc which maybe popular next year or so but I'm fine with the HD DVD, it can also do the same thing as the Xbox in terms of hooking up with the PC and uploading music from Ipods, videos, photos, etc etc. The PS3 also comes standard with the 20GB for the 499USD and a 60GB for 599USD. Multiplayer is important too, a way for gamers to talk and bash each others brain out with that chain-saw... So... The Wii. I'm not sure about the Wii having multiplayer capabilitys, but I'm sure it does, but along with the multiplayer, you can also go on WiiConnect to download old school games such as Sonic, Mario.. Etc and customize your own avatar or 3D person you use to talk and socialize with others in the Wii World.

The wii has a motion sensitive controller which will make the games very exciting, and the PS3's motion sensitive controller is pretty much worthless, since they just stole it off of Nintendo and put it together really fast.

PS3 will be (VERY) expensive, and no, it will NOT play HD DVDs, it will play BLU-RAY DVDs, but who knows how long that format will be around. The 360 will play HD DVDs, which are not compatible with Blu-Ray, and no one knows how the war between those two is going to play out. The Wii will not support either at launch, and no one has said whether there are plans to add support for either in the future. Last I heard, neither the 360 or the PS3 is backwards completely backwards compatible. Both support previous gen games with an software driven emulator, and Sony's previous claims for full backward compatibility have become suspect. The Wii on the other hand, will have 30 'old school' titles (from NES, SNES, Genesis, N64, and Turbo-Grafx 16) available for download at launch, with plans to release many more in the future. They will by far have the BEST backwards compatibility. As for games, third party produces are trying to jump on the band wagon left & right for the Wii. Ubisoft has confirmed 7 at launch, bringing the total to 30 for launch, and 40 by year end (plus downloadable previous gen games). Ubisoft has also confirmed a new Prince Of Persia game for the Wii (the only console a new POP game has been confirmed for at this point). It will also have full GC compatibility, and it will play DVDs, have integrated wireless, a spot for a SD card, and will have ports for 4 GC controllers. At a confirmed $249 price, with 1 million units shipping at launch, and an additional 3 - 4 million before year end, you shouldn't have a problem finding one, whereas the the PS3 may be dificult to find (unless, of course, the $500 - $700 price tag will be a sales deterrent, as some people suspect). All the buzz is that the PS loyalists will be standing in line for the PS3s, but the Wii will be the really hot commodity this Christmas, and should be taking back some market share from Sony and Microsoft. My personal opinion is that the Wii is the best deal for the money, especially if all you want is a game console. Yes, the others will do other things, but it's not like those things can't be bought elsewhere, and personally, I'd rather have my game console separate from my DVD player & other electronics, especially until we know which high definition format will become the standard for DVDs.

PS3 will launch with literally thousands of titles due its backwards capabilities plus 21 new games and the possibility of 50 total by Christmas and Blu-Ray. It has enough processing power to theoretically run 1 Wii and 5 360 games at the same time. Price will be the only con for the PS3 in this comparison. In reference to the copying Sony does, BlueTooth is a wireless format for low bandwidth data saying Sony stole the idea from Microsoft is ridiculous.

The 360 has only a few big name games and most tend to be first-person shooters.

I don't know which one will be better to buy, because each one has its own unique features. I will buy both."", ""In terms of which console will be the best... Its an interesting question. In economics, Milton Friedman of the Chicago school of economics observed that as you increase the amount of an input, the utility you derive from each additional unit of input decreases. In other words, you really like the first pizza, the second pizza is okay, the third pizza was just barely worth the money and you wouldn't even consider eating a fourth pizza. What does this have to do with anything? Well, there is going to be a diminishing level of enjoyment you will get out of graphics. As the graphics get better and better, there is less and less enjoyement had over better graphics. Take for example, the evolution of nintendo. From SNES-N64, wow much better 2-D to 3D! From N64-GC, better graphics, but not as revolutionary as from SNES to 64. Basic economic thought aside, I lament both Sony and Xbox for taking such a boring route to their nex-gen systems. Its so safe to just add more processing power, better graphics cards and extra little features. While these systems are indeed powerful, theres nothing really quite innovative about them. They chose the typical path for making a better video game system. I will buy a wii, even after my Gamecube has been siting collecting dust for the past two years while I played World of Warcraft. Honestly, if there was no cool controller thing, I wouldn't have bought any system at all. I've played every console game abazillion times now, from Vincent may cry (haha) to bomberman. If I had a linear controller yet again, I would be bored out of my skull. The wii controller is definately a breath of fresh air in an industry afraid to take risks. Now, I'm not saying you cant have fun with the other systems. Of course you can. Halo for the Xbox 360 almost makes up for the cost of the entire system and you know the PS3 will have a killer lineup of RPGs as they always do.

ps3,wii,"What should I buy, what one is better? PS3, Wii, XBOX360?","It really depends what you're looking for in a game system.

Graphically, they're pretty much all the same.  The games available for all of them are also pretty much the same (except for the Wii--more on that below).  And it would also depend on your budget.  PS3 is most expensive, followed by 360, and cheapest is the Wii.

The 360 is much better for online gaming.  XboxLive is well established.  The PS3 is online capable but Sony hasn't done much in the way of support for it.  The Wii's online gaming is pretty dismal right now, but Nintendo is working on it.

If you accept Sony's claim that Blu-Ray is the video format of the future, and plan on using your game system to watch movies on, then the PS3 is the way to go.  But remember Betamax?  Sony thought that would work too.  The 360 has an HD DVD player available for it.  Sorry, but I'm unsure of the Wii's video capabilities.

The Wii is the ultimate party game system.  With it's new controllers and party-type games, it is a whole lot of fun.  Nintendo has some great game franchises that are perfect for parties (think Mario Kart).  The nunchaku controller will keep you moving around as you play.  A lot.  Playing the bowling game that comes with it is like going down to the local alley and throwing 10 frames.  Granted, it's a 2 oz. controller, not a heavy bowling ball.

Personally, I would have to go with the 360 as my first system.  It's cheaper than the PS3 and will have most the games I'm interested in.  Sony is slowly losing it's exclusive franchises.  But I do miss Final Fantasy...

I'm definetely going to buy a Wii as a second system though.  There is too much interesting stuff going on with it to not have one.  It's cheap enough to warrant having it in addition to a 360 or PS3.

Hopefully I've said something here that helps you.  I would also recommend buying a couple of gaming magazines and seeing what they have to say about these systems.  It's a big investment, some good research would be advisable.","[""It really depends what you're looking for in a game system.\n\nGraphically, they're pretty much all the same.

ps3,wii,"what got better reviews between xbox360,ps3,wii?",PS3,"['PS3', ""It really depends on what you are looking for in a system, as all of the systems have had good reviews, bad reviews, and some mixed. The only thing that I can add is that you will be hard pressed to find negative reviews for the Wii out of reviewers that have actually tried the system.  Basically Wii's only real downside is that the graphics are not as good as a PS3 or 360, since it doesn't support anything higher than 480p. Many reviewers have showed the system to non-gamers, and I have yet to read about a non-gamer that didn't like it. By the same token, I have heard very few gamer types that have tried it and not liked it, and most of those that didn't did not spend very much time with it. My recommendation would be to get your hands and try each system yourself, but my bets are on the Wii, which actually a safer bet considering it costs less to begin with."", 'yes xbox makes you pay an extra 200 bux for the HD player but remember you only paid about 400 bux retail for it and ps3 is 600 bux...add the prices and you get the same EXACT price', 'PS3', ""well i dont know what reviews you mean. there are reviews on certain websites, but they are very unreliable, they just give positive comments to the company that pays them the most. i work at gamestop and i get emails from customers that have played their consoles. about 60% of people were dissapointed with their 360. and 20% were dissapointed with their PS3.  here's my review. and iv'e played all of them. PS3 all the way. lets consider the differences.  PS3 has full HD support. neither the Wii or the 360 have anything close to that. PS3 has blu-ray compatibility. The Wii has nothing of the sort. and the 360 requires you spend $200 to play HD DVDs which arent even as good as blu-ray discs. Ps3 can store up to 60GB of music movies and games. 360 can store 20GB and Wii can store jack ****. Ps3 had games like resistance, Lair, Full auto 2, Motorstorm. the only good game of the 360 is halo 3, which wont be here until next november. PS3 has the option of HDMI, AV, Coaxial, or component output, the 360 gives you one cable that will use either A/V or Component, and they have the nerve to call the component output HD. wii makes you use AV. The Blu-ray discs used for PS3 games make the games enormous, and worth much more time. i beat gears of war on the 360 in 9 hours. i have been playing resistance for 12 hours and i am about one quarter the way through. the Wii isn't even worth mentioning here, all their games are aimed at children and can be finished with within 4 hours.  there is really no question as to which is better. the only reason you may hear negative things about the PS3 is because people have decided to jump on some PS3 hating bandwagon. they are the same ignorant dipshits that barge into best buy to buy an iPod without considering other players by creative.  'Gotta get an iPod, thats what everyone else has, everyone hates the PS3, i gotta hate it too' come on, grow up, get your own opinion."", ""How can you say the 360 dosn't have any good games but Halo 3 Britian. Do they not ship games there like Gears of War, Oblivion, Ghost Recon and Dead Rising.

The PS3 is very difficult for developers to make games for and Sony relies almost exclusivly on 3rd party developers. Reminds me of another system Dreamcast.

The Wii hopfully will be the top system Nintedo gets it they don't have all the bells and wistles but when it comes down to it their games are fun to play allowing people to download old NES, SNES, N64 games and play online. Also Sony has ripped off Nintendo for years and years the motion sensor controler for PS3 is a joke it was developed in 2 months only after the Wii was unveiled. Nintendo waited purposely so sony couldn't steal from them again the ps3 was shown with regular controlers and all the graphic upgardes a few days later the wii came out to show off their cool controlers. Sony stole the idea and added the feature to their designs just as they did the analog stick and rumble feature for playstation. Playstation fan boys will continue to eat up sonys products and to answer the orginal question its hard to review systems the PS3 is better in everyway to the other systems on paper but the reviews come down to the games so in order its  1. Xbox 360 (year head start tons of software and good games avialible) 2. Wii (Zelda best game of holiday season other than GoW plus revolutionary control with Wii sports makes for fun games) 3.

However, if its overpriced and in short supply to begin with then people may be put off.', 'the Nintendo is completely different to the other two, and the PS3 is more powerfull than the 360.... Even though it isnt out yet... PS3 all the way.... I want one! NOW!', 'PS3 by far according to independant review on the Gadget Show the other day...', 'Have to agree that ps3 WILL be the bomb', 'PS3 judging by all the statistics and pre-release reviews', 'definitely PS3, just look at all the things this thing can do...Xbox 360 and Wii simply dont have tech to compete with the PS3', 'As an X-Box owner I have to say, unfortuantly the best option will be the PS3 no matter what anyone tells you.', ""Too many people are giving the PS3 credit before it's due.  From a technical standpoint, the PS3 will have many problems.  Blu-Ray is a very poor design and will cause many headaches from media going bad.  That and the cost of the PS3 will hold it far behind the others.  PS3 will be good, but it's impossible at this time to determine if it's better, or even as good as the other two major players.  In modern console gaming, the concept of exclusive titles is dying.  So in that alone, I'd go for the unit with the best bang for the buck.  You can have both the Xbox360 and a Wii for the price of a PS3. Here's a list of some of the PS3 problems: - Blu-Ray is going to be a big problem for the PS3.  Don't buy it to play movies, because you won't be able to without the correct equipment.  It won't play movies on just any TV. - Expensive.  Both to buy and to maintain.  Expect $70 to $100 games for the PS3 very soon.  Sony is expected to loose about 2 billion in the first year alone from the PS3, so they'll have to make up ground by over charging for games. - Really not more powerfull than the competition.  The PS3 was designed over 1 year ago, so on it's market debut, it's already past prime in terms of Moore's law.  It's process, though differently laid out, is functionally identical to both the other consoles. (all are based on the same IBM PowerPC chip.)  And the graphics engines in both the 360 and the PS3 are functionally identical. Sony is in a world of hurt.  The PS3 would have been a great machine if it had been released on time, without the ill-fated blu-ray drive.  All the so-called 'hype' right now is only there due to Sony's massive advertising initiative.  Once these machines hit the market, and the Sony ad machine starts to run out of money, expect it to start to fail on the market.  Be sure to read the linked stories.  Google or Yahoo for 'sony ps3 failure' and you'll find tons more.  Many of them are from prodomonant media sources.  Sony's troubles go far beyond just battery recalls..."", 'The Nintendo Wii!!!!!', ""Nobody here plays online obviously.  If you are an online gamer, then the 360 is the hands down winner.  Sony has never been able to put together an online gaming model.  And I don't expect that will change with the PS3.  Xbox Live, on the other hand, is over 1 million subscribers strong.  In less than 2 weeks, HD movies will be available for download to the hard drive.  So you will be able to watch HD movies without ANY HD drive, Blue-Ray, HD, or otherwise. If you are going to connect the console to the internet and game online, you have to go 360.  Xbox Live is the bomb.""]","the nintendo wii has undeniable advantages.

It still has some of the same games as the 360 but with the Unique controller you have a better experience with the game like Madden '07. so Price aside i would still have to go with the Nintendo Wii.

But i think that you are the drone here, this game look way better then the ps3 version, i am honest!! PS3 power is inferior to the 360.
you should have said the xbox360 is just inferior to the Ps3. This ""compression"" will make Rage on the Xbox 360 graphically inferior to Rage on the PS3 . EXC is right factually that PS3 hardware wise is superior to the 360. Nah, I find the 360 inferior to the PS3. lol Just more proof the Xbox is inferior to PS3 .","It's simple!

ps3,wii,"Who will win the next gen war PS3,360,or wii?","There are many fanboys answering this question, but the only true answer is that nobody can know.

The 360 has set itself up as a very well designed system with a potential to come out on top. It certainly has done several things right, but the most important being its online capabilities.

The PS3 is set up, in my opinion, to be a real disappointment. The fact is that, for at least a few years, it cannot live up to the hype(cell processing is not only experimental, it is called pointless by most programmers and game developers HATE developing for it, in general. It's a pain to program for). That, coupled with scandal within Sony, and the fact that it wont reach widespread accessibility until Spring of next year, makes the PS3 look like a flop. I don't even want to get into all of the PR follies Sony has made, but the ""just get a second job"" comment and the suggestion that Nintendo stole the motion sensing idea from them jump immediately to mind.

Nintendo stands to absolutely make the most money this quarter. From a retail standpoint, the Wii is a much better sale (higher margins for retailer, lower cost, etc...). Nintendo can also make money on each console, versus the loss Microsoft and Sony take on their consoles. This ties in very nicely with the fact that there will be so many Wii available this quarter, so people going in to buy a PS3 will, most likely, walk out with a Wii. And the Wii looks like FUN.

What are people going to spend the most money on? PS3. No contest. One word. eBay.

But as for a long-term winner, I look at the details and say that Wii in the right place at the right time. I think that all of the systems have a chance, but to call the whole thing a war is unfair. What constitutes winning? Most financial gain will definitely go to Nintendo. Most consoles sold will probably go to Nintendo as well. Best graphics will go to PS3 in the long run, but they are likely to fail in all other areas. And the 360 is certainly the console which has shown widespread appeal. But the whole contest is highly subjective, and to call it a war is just unfair.

Nintendo has always brought out the fun, with every system. : )', 'The Wii of course, The PS3 is gonna be like the PS2 just the PS3 will have better graphics. The wii is more fun cause u can actually pretend the remote is the sword. For example in Wii sports you play tennis kinda like the way you would play it in real life. The 360 has fun online though its really hard to get connection and lagz a lot. I think sony has no more ideas. The Ps3 will be exactly like the ps2. So there u have it.

The reason are faster, greater and cheaper. you should have said the xbox360 is just inferior to the Ps3. I hope PS3 doesn't have very much better graphics,textures or something graphically important than Xbox360.... . The PS3 is, for me, 10 times better than the XBox360 or the Wii, so I'm putting up with this. Why don't we wait until the games come out before we make statements like ""PS3 is greater than Xbox360"". As if we are dumb assholes who purchased a relatively expensive machine (which is far faaaaaaaarrr superior to Xbox360).
XBOX360 had far superior games to the PS3. Now also most games that came out on PS3 were not any better than Xbox360...at least graphically. Activision even said that the PS3 version is inferior to the XBox360. I actually had someone the other day tell me that ""Xbox360 has way better coding than PS3. Most agree that the Xbox360 is superior to the current systems (Wii and PS3) when it comes to community and ease of use setting up and inviting friends to play online.","I came to the conclusion that ps3 is better, because of faster, greater and cheaper.

First of all you have the Wii which comes in at a lesser price, the opportunity to download classic games (which it seems is what people are talking about a lot lately games that have replayabilty and were just so much fun back then), and the new way of playing with the new controller which is going to revolutionize the way we all play games. Second you have the PS3 which has such a hefty price even for the stripped down version.  Hardware wise yeah better but at what cost.  They are sticking with the blue-ray technology but what happens if everyone else desides to go with the HD technology?  Everyone who bought a PS3 will be screwed cause the disks wont be as mass produced and the cost of games will go up, plus the blue-ray player will be worthless cause it wont play HD disks. Third and certainly not last you have the 360.  While everything is being released now the 360 is in its second generation or games.  Developers know the software and know how to make the games better.  Just look at whats out and going to be coming out soon (Gears of War, F.E.A.R., and of course Halo 3).  The price is between the other two and with big games coming up with graphics which are almost identicle to PS3.

All in all, it's just a matter of opinion and preference.  For me, they are kinda like pokemon's where I just wanna own 'em all!!!"", ""Games: Right not the 360 has it for the games seeing as PS3 just came out. The games that are out for the PS3 are good and there are more to come so thats a toss up. I guess for the moment 360 has it. Controllers: PS3 easily...I dont like that they took the rumble out BUT they have a really far reaching wireless capability. Also they can be used in games just like the Wii controller i.e moving the controller to act out different movements on the game. The x box controllers suck.  Prices: Ok... The PS3 is expensive but its less than a regular blu-ray disk player and you get more. The X box plays HD-DVDs but the major fall back to that is first off not all titles are coming out on HD-DVD...basically all the good movies will be on Blu-Ray. So the price for the PS3 for what its worth is reasonable. Also you have to think about that fact that it costs Sony $810 to make one console so they're actually losing money to give their customers a decent price. I dont know if it breaks that easily. It broke the same on smashmyps3.com as it did on smashmyxbox.com  Graphics... WELL personally i think the PS3 takes this as well. The only major fall back is that if you dont have a HDTV then you're not getting the full effect and its kind of pointless to buy. I have a HDTV 1080i and it looks amazing. If you have a regular TV than you wont get the same effects. So To be fair i'll give leave it as a tie between PS3 and 360.  ...Other stuff... Its also about personal prefrence. If you have a PS2 with like 42975358 games than a PS3 would be a good investment. You could still play your games (with a lil graphic upgrade =D) and play new games as well.

It has fun games with different ratings while the Ps3 and xbox360 have the same games everytime. All of their games are rated mature and they all have to do with Shooting, Wars, and fighting. The Wii comes with all genres of games. I tried the motion sensing controller and it was fun and easy to use. If you like shooting games, you could use the controller as a gun and point it at the screen like the gun in the original Nintendo. You could also browse the internet, download pics from your digital camera, send messages to other people, download classic games online, and play gamecube games on it. Wii is the cheapest system and the most fun to play.

Modding your Wii is way harder for the average person than simply buying an R4 or something. But the 3DS has gotten better, and the Wii U is getting there as well, seemingly quicker than the 3DS did.
Wii MotionPlus purports to track players' movements in finer detail and with greater accuracy than the Wii hardware alone. In fact, the video of Xenoblade looked inferior to the Wii release.

ps3,wii,PS3 - Wii - Xbox360?----Best one----?,"It's hard to say which system is better than the other, considering that two of the group (PS3 and Wii) haven't had their debut yet.  However, I still stick to my belief that the best system available does depend on the eye of the beholder, or more specifically the purchaser.  The PS3 is the most powerful system on the market, with its Blueray technology, making the graphics engine more powerful and disc memory greater, however, the price tag for the PS3 IS steep but rightly so.  Also, sadly what the people mentioned above is also true, the fact that certain people will buy multiple game systems (which sucks since only 400,000 will be shipped to the U.S. this 19th) and double the price on Ebay.  However, if you truly desire the PS3, paying that high cost or just waiting a few months shouldn't be too much of a hassle.  In contrast, the Wii is technologically the weakest system on the market when looking at statistics, however it makes up for this with its new, innovative way of gaming.  Not only is the price tag for the Wii inexpensive ($250 for the system and only $50 for the games) but the chance of you getting one is greater when, as stated in Game Pro magazine, there is going to be 1,000,000 units shipped to the U.S on the Nov. 19th.  Also, with an online service from the start that allows you to download classic Nintendo games from previous systems for $5 -$10 and another, alternative control available if you don't desire the new Wii remote and Nunchuk (Even though Game Pro magazine tested the controller with Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess and said it worked flawlessly), the Wii is a haven for any Nintendo fan and a strong option for any gamer.  Finally, the Xbox 360 is moderately priced for its capabilities and is reliable for its spectacular online capabilities.  Also, with games like Ninja Gaiden Sigma and Halo 3 (Which the staff at Electronic Gaming Monthly have already demoed, even though it won't be avaible until late 2007), the Xbox 360 is sure to be a system that won't let down.

    As stated before, I believe that the system you desire is all in your preference, because none of these gaming companies should be going anywhere anytime soon.  Also, regarding the waiting several months to get the systems, I believe that all gamers understand me when I say there is no feeling like getting the latest gaming system and games as quickly as possible.  Now, don't misunderstand me, it IS VERY wise to wait to pick up your newest game system after the price has dropped and the bugs have been worked out but I believe you meet the same goal by buying a warranty with your new system upon purchase.  That way if the system scrambles, you can just trade it in for a new one.  Just remember, when shopping for the latest game system, I don't believe its not a matter of what is best but what you like, especially considering that all of the game systems have something to offer.  For example, I'm mostly a Nintendo fan, but I like the works of Microsoft and Sony as well.  So, I'm going to start off buying a Wii, which is the cheapest from the start, then I'm going to wait until prices drop and pick up a PS3 and an Xbox 360.  What will you do?  I leave that up to you.

I've been collecting for a long time now. Anyhow, I took the plung and bought one off of those 'people'(nazi's) on emaby.

Now on my third I'm getting ready to send it back. is the 360 a great machine? hell yes...when it works.  No one can tell you yet if the PS3 or the WII is going to be durable. and why spend 250/600 for something that is going to break down all the time.  Lastly, Some jerk will go into your local walmart and buy 20 of each. then he will sit on Ebay and create a market for these machines. Now a PS3 that would have cost you 600 is now going to be 1500 all so some jerk can turn a couple of bucks at your expense.

Either way, I always think it's best to wait until the initial market frenzy has settled down and the first generation of machines have been sold.

of pressing a button. of course if this catches on it will pretty much revolutionize the game industry however i think nintendo's got an uphill battle ahead of them, because most developers will find it very complicated and time consuming (and therefore more expensive) programming thier games to respond to different controller movements. this could result in most companies simply leaving the wii

The ps3 and it's super gay prices has got to go(at least until it's price drops and they get better games).

It crashes alot if played for lengths at a time, about 6 hours, if you buy one, you should only play for about 6 hours, let it cool for about 1 hour, then you can play again with no worry. Thats why i think you should get the 360 over the PS3 (Wii optional if not alot of cash)"", ""I would say Nintendo Wii. It's on my Christmas list. The PS3 is WAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYY TOO OVERPRICED!!!

Neither is 'better' than the other. Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft all have their 'ocean' of fans so different people are going to say one's better than the other whether they've always had Playstations, always bought Nintendo products, or whatever. Most people would say PS3 just cuz it's more powerful. If i had the money right now i'd get the PS3 or even both but i'd say the 360 is better than both because it's got the head start, the most games, and almost a year to fix any problems with the system. You'll have to wait a few months to see how well the PS3 or the Wii does so that question can't really be answered right now."", ""Nintendo has gone in a different direction and have left graphics at the door and have pushed forward with Innovation. The controller is truly amazing and is quick to get use to. You can't even play DVDs on the Wii as originally thought you could. The main reason to stick with Nintendo is for their amazing first party games: Zelda, Mario, Metroid, Smash, among others. If the first party games do not appeal to you, maybe Wii is not for you. PS3 has gone with graphics and it shows. The games I have seen look amazing. Unfortunately the price tag is too much for me to ever even think about. If it dropped to $300 I would consider it. The inclusion of Blue Ray could not be considered that great, as I don't think the technology is that much different to even take off. The games will start pouring in mid next year to the end of next year, with the typical exclusives that we are use to on their previous system. Will Playstation continue its reign as the top system? It is looking like it might, but Nintendo will take some of its previous control away (maybe even the 360)."", ""nintendo wii is better because it don't need a fan and can't over heat."", 'i guess it depends...playstations are known to carry the bulk of games with them, but there are not many for the ps3. If you are graphics crazy and love the best of everything get a ps3. However, if you are looking to spend less and want a game system with less special features and a bit stripped down graphics get a wii. If you have the money though i would suggest a ps3 as it is going to have the new final fantasy on it along with a new line of games. Perhaps if you buy the wii, then if you see the ps3 you might desire it, but if you have the ps3 there is nothing to desire as it is top of the line!', 'This is coming from a mom that never gets to pay video games with out my child having a breakdown in laughter.  The Wii is awesome.  I liked it number one because it came with Wii Sports.  I did not have to drop 60.00 to get a game before we could play.  My neighbor camped out for 4 days for a Playstation 3 and it is back at the store already.  It crashed and the game is still inside it!  This Wii has been flawless.

We understand Sony trying to hype up their failing portable console, but saying it's better than the Wii U is really pushing it. Xbox and Playstation games aren't magically better than Nintendo games because the consoles are more powerful than the Wii. The reality is far less entertaining: neither of the consoles from Sony or Microsoft will do any better than Wii U. And here's why."" The PS3 truly is technologically superior to both the Xbox 360 and the Wii, providing stunning graphics that will impress the most cynical of gamers. It's a much better improvement than when the Wii was released.
It was 10x harder to work with than the X360 or Wii. Sony's prototype is not only better than Wii Motion Plus, but Sony will actually put theirs to use. I don't think the Wii U will come out with specs equal or greater than the next Sony or MS consoles. Oh well, I'll just go play every digital Wii game I own on my Wii U since Nintendo is better at online backwards compatibility than Sony. This is why the PS3 controller is inferior to the Wii and Xbox360 controller.","I came to the conclusion that sony is better, because of greater, cheaper and faster.

Looking Forward to Most: Resistance: Fall of Man Wii: i hope it will be great, the control looks incredible and the games look allright too. the only thing im nervous about is the controller works well or not. also being able to get ony nintendo games is great (is there going to be a super smash bros??)

And the rumors about overheating...erroneous, only less than 1% overheated and that was due to the new manufacturing techniques that were used.

If your interest is solely on crisp beautiful graphics, then you have to rule out Wii. If you don't mind too much about graphics and gameplay is priority, then you need to ask what kind of gameplay you like. Wii, being most different from the other two systems, have games that attract more wider audience. The gameplay leans toward fantasy over realism. If you are interested in board games and entertaining guess, then I'd highly suggest Wii. But, if you're more of a single player or playing platform games online, then you should look towards PS3 and Xbox 360.  The problem with comparing Xbox 360 and PS3 is that they are still in their early stages. In other words, there aren't enough games for both systems yet. If I was to narrow down between Xbox 360 and PS3, I'd put my bet on PS3. The reason is because Japan prefers Sony over Microsoft.

As the Nintendo relies on sony, and sony is building its own custom solution, Im betting the sony one will take the cake as every sony machine has upon release into its market. If you doubt it, look at the real time rendered FF7 Video that was shown on the PS3 prototype.', ""I know I've answered this exact same question before, but I'll do it again. In the simplest of terms, the 'best' system is the one with the games you want to play on it. These days most of the big games (outside of the platform franchises) get ported to all the consoles, but there are always some games (most notably are Nintendo games) that are only on one console. And, of course, with the radical control scheme of the Wii, it looks like there will be fewer cross-platform games on the Wii and more first- and third-party Wii-specific games. At the moment the Xbox 360 is the only console in the market, so if you want something now that's your only choice. However, by the year's end we'll also see the PS3 and the Wii. So if you're willing to wait, you'll have 3 consoles to choose from. My biggest recommendation is to get the Wii. Regardless of whether or not you get another console, the Wii will be not only the cheapest, but also the most fun of the three consoles, given Nintendo's gaming and controlling innovations, as well as their history of producing fun games. It will also have a great lineup - last I checked, there was supposed to be something like 27 games available at launch for the Wii. I'm not even sure if there are 27 games out for the Xbox 360 yet ;) If you have the cash for a second console, this is where it gets harder. In terms of price, the Xbox 360 + the Wii will cost about the same as the PS3, so that's a big point to think about. Another thing is the PS3, while pricey, is looking like it's not going to be as good as once thought. They've slashed some features and power, and rumor has it the Cell processor (the new technology at the heart of the PS3) will have some serious flaws. In the contest between the Xbox 360 and the PS3, probably the most important factor is the games you want to play. However, the PS3 is pretty pricey and the rumors about the processor flaws has me quite concerned. As for myself, I own an Xbox 360 and I'm definitely going to get a Wii. And while I absolutely love the Final Fantasy series, it's going to take a *lot* to convince me to get a PS3. Note: to the person who said 'The nintendo was running off of 3 sony processors when it ran at E3,' that's 100% *false*. The Wii was running off of essentially modified GameCube hardware at E3. Which means the actual production versions will look even better than the demonstration at E3. And if you want more technical details, the CPU of the GameCube is called Gekko and was produced by IBM."", 'wii']","the nintendo wii has undeniable advantages.

Cadillac is just selling a name and most models have a cheaper GM version (eg, DTS is actually a buick lucerne) and although the ES is just a dressed up Camry, the styling and interior differences really are starting to separate Toyota from Lexus.  This wasn't the case just a couple of years ago but times certainly have moved on.  But keep in mind, if you have the money to buy either and you can afford expensive servicing (which you should) then look at BMW.  BMW is not the upscale version of any car company.  BMW makes BMWs and that is it (although they did dabble in Range Rover before selling it to Ford).

The reason are quicker and lighter. The Command system and interface is more responsive and a smoother experience all-around than what Lexus currently offers. Infiniti has a better chance of success in Europe than Lexus . There isn't a nicer 2005 Lexus ES than this one-owner gem. As a matter of fact the new V6 is faster then our current Lexus GX470. Sure you can get cars with better features than a ""Rolls Royce"", faster (Audi), better engines (Mercedes), better transmissions (Lexus), better, this and that (others).
Still, the Audi RS 5 is only a tenth of a second slower than the Lexus RC F. . To put it in perspective the Yellowbird went through the quarter mile at 11.7secs which is only one tenth of a second slower than a Lexus LFA., it is also a tenth faster than a Lamborghini Murcielago to 120mph. Sure, the A5 2.0T is a bit slower than the Lexus, but its handling and the actual driving experience are both superior. The new A8 doing way better than the previous car proves that Audi is doing something right, though at a slower pace than MB/BMW/Lexus. The grade of leather used is a bit harder than those used on any given Lexus.","After much thought, I realized that  a is better, because of quicker and lighter.

The reason are greater and faster. I find the Wii a better GameCube player than the GameCube is.

Even Nintendo's worst selling console, the Gamecube, had a much better library of software than the Wii did. It's just another good example of why I still like the GameCube better than the Wii. What is worrying, though, is the fact that the Wii U is bombing harder than the Gamecube and the N64, and that its circumstances are significantly worse. I question whether they'd ignore the Wii U library in the future if this home console flounders worse than the Gamecube did.

The reason are easier, lighter and safer. Modern timber structure holds many virtues in the fields of construction, such as energy-saving, green, aesthetics, ect, superior to concrete and steel bridge. However, timber piles driven below the water table can last indefinitely; treated timber can withstand acidic and alkaline soil conditions better than concrete. ""A timber building, typically lighter than a brick, concrete or steel building, therefore induces lower earthquake loads."" Massive timber, by its very nature, can withstand extreme fire loads and maintain structural integrity better than steel or concrete buildings, which I'm sure you know this already. The replacement of timber track components is responsible for producing greenhouse gas emissions six times greater than equivalent reinforced concrete counterparts.
Timber does not require water to be present on the site during construction and the lack of drying time will allow the shell of a building to be assembled far quicker then if excessive concrete is used. Your coop needs dry nesting boxes and an impervious floor - meaning that it won't soak up moisture, so concrete is better than timber or earth. With respect to the absolute value of non-renewable EE, the amount associated with the concrete design case was greater than the timber case by almost 7 terajoules. Fossil fuel depletion was the only impact category where the concrete-framed design was superior, displaying a 6% improvement over the laminated timber scenario. On sunny days, the concrete-walled building was cooler than the timber-walled building, overheated less frequently, and was significantly more comfortable than the timber-walled building.","It's simple!

playstation,wii,"Nintendo Wii, XBOX 360, or PlayStation 3? Your pick and why?","The best way to choose is to describe your style of play:

Nintendo Wii will attract users to the new concept of gaming. The goal for Nintendo is to attract a lot of customers who dont really play games. The graphics are nowhere near as good as PS3 or Xbox 3 but there not aiming for that. There emphasis is on gameplay and fun. If it will be like the gamecube then the big problem may be its lack of games. Hopefully developers will be able to provide a large library of games for the Wii, that we will have to wait and see.

PS3 the success of the PS1 and PS2 shows that its the dominant system. But with the price tag of 500-600 dollars. That alone is discouraging a lot of people away from the system as it is. There opening launch of games is nice and as the previous 2 systems, they have a large variety of games. Also, a good system to buy for people who like RPGs (Role Playing Games)

XBOX360: Console is already out now. Graphics are also suberb just like the PS3 and for who has better graphics and sound thats debateable. HALO is an awesome game but will take next year for that to come out. They have a big emphasis games on FPS (First Person Shooter). Break it down to this.

Nintendo: Innovative, User Friendly, Kiddy Games, not as expensive as the other systems. 
XBOX360: Best System for Online Play (but requires a fee of course)
PS3: High Price Tag System but will also have the largest library of games to choose from. 

My overall choice, Nintendo Wii mainly because its something different and the Wii sports looks like a lot of fun to play. And I also have a lot of fun with friends who come over and we play mario party. Big time fun factor with 4 friends in 1 room.

Actually, since I already have a GC (and the fact it's compatable) and really don't want or particularly need online play (yes, it's nice, but I don't like HALO style games on consoles), I'm going with the Wii. As for 3rd party, Wii's confirmed lauch titles from Activision (Call of Duty 3, Tony Hawk), Square-Enix (FF), SNK, Ubisoft, THQ, Konami, and of course SEGA.

Personally, I can't imagine spending $600 on a system before a game is purchased (Keep in mind that the $500 version does not have the HDMI or any way to add it on so you will never get the 1080P that they promise). You can actually buy a Nintendo Wii and XBOX 360 for the price of the PS3...wrap your head around that...

The reason are easier, greater and lighter. I'm wondering though if Nintendo should have said that the Nintendo Wii U would be better then the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. We know that the new console will be a hardware step up from the Wii, and at least on par with or better than the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in terms of graphics. Fans will quickly point out that the hardware capabilities of Nintendo Wii U are equal or in some cases better then Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 consoles. What is on offer right here, right now, is actually a far better experience than the glitch-ridden Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions of FIFA 13 , and miles ahead of the Wii and 3DS editions as well. This is a pretty impressive launch list, much better than the Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3 had when they launched.
Even with that uptick, the Nintendo Wii U is selling worse on a monthly basis in the US than the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 have ever sold over the last seven years. For kids older than 12, gaming does a little worse; the Wii U only comes in at 17% while its older brethren the PlayStation 3 sitting at 8% and the Xbox 360 at 7%. Nintendo's been famously hesitant to acknowledge that this might be an area in which the HD-capable Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 consoles are superior, but the recent release of a Netflix disc for the Nintendo Wii put that console's failings in sharp relief. The Nintendo Wii U's processor is slower than its counterparts in the years-old Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, and the Wii U graphics chip either matches or is slightly faster than its rivals' graphics chips. But Game Informer said it could not confirm if the graphics would be better than that of the Xbox 360 or the Sony PlayStation 3.","It's simple! Nintendo wii is better, because of easier, greater and lighter. But it will be useful for you to know that playstation 3 is faster, cheaper and older."

After a few months when developers can really tap into the systems power you will see games with more quality,gameplay and graphics wise, since it is proven it has more power then the 360 and will eventually sell more units then the 360, and the SIXAXIS thing really is great once you experience it for urself, some think its a gimic but trust me its not. Do some research on proper and resourcable game sites and you will know that the ps3 is overall a better system(not saying the 360 is not good but ps3 is deffinetly better as per giving u bang per buck)', ""I would go with the Wii if you want qualities like the interactve controller and good games. PS3 has no vibration and the graphics aren't that good unless you have an HD tv. The no vibration is a bad thing. Xbox 360 has Xbox live and everybody wants that but it only has one good game Halo3 that will be awesome. The wii does have vibration and sound in its controllers. It is really fun unlessyou want a really big action packed game. The ps3 has a good game Resitance Fall of Man that is a really good game. I would go with the wii if you are old or young"", ""It depends on what you're looking for, and how big your wallet is.  If cost is an issue, then your best bet is the Wii.  Both the system and games are a lot cheaper.  If you're into violent and gory games, then this system probably won't be your cup of tea.  The controller is a neat novelty, 'though I'm not sure if it would get old or not.   If you're big into High Definition gaming, then your best bet is the PS3.  The blu-ray disc can hold 50 gb, so you can imagine the possibilities with future games (true high def graphics and more features than a dvd format game, which could hold 4.3 gb).    Another big benefit is the ability to watch blu-ray movies (mind you, it cost a lot to buy one right now).  If you want to buy a blu-ray dvd player, it'd cost you over a grand right now, so the PS3 is actually cheaper than the dvd player!  (I think Sony is losing $250 per unit sold).  You'll only benefit from the machine if you have a high def t.v., of course.  I think online play is also free (for now, at least).  Still, $650 cdn for a game machine is a lot of dough to shell out, especially when it doesn't even include a game!  If you can afford the steep price (and patient enough to wait a while until more becomes available), then the PS3 is the way to go. If you want HD gaming right now, then the XBox 360 is for you.  It has a year head start, so there are quite a few games out already.  This means that you should have no problems finding games than you actually want to play right now.  The online community is established as well, but the major drawback is that you would have to pay.  You could buy a premium version of the machine with several games for about $500 cdn, so it's a lot cheaper than the PS3.  However, you won't be able to play HD dvds unless you buy an add-on player for about $200 cdn.  This means that the cost could be as high as the PS3.   Another drawback is that the game runs on dvds, which can only hold about 8.6 gb (dual).   This means that if a company makes a game for both the PS3 and Xbox 360, it'd be more likely that the PS3 version would have enhanced graphics or additional features since its discs could hold 50 gb.  On the upside, the Xbox 360 is benchmarked to be faster than the PS3 (can't remember where I read it). I'm leaning more towards the PS3 because I'm big into HD movies.  Since I'd pretty much have to pay PS3 price to watch HD movies on an XBOX 360, might as well buy the PS3!  (HD dvd movies are a bit cheaper to buy than blu-ray movies, however).  The PS3 doesn't have much games right now, but give it time;  I'm sure there'll be some coming up that will blow everyone away. Mind you, it takes more than good graphics to make a good game!"", ""Wii: great cool controller I have played a Wii  personally and it is very fun new way to game. but if your a hardcore gamer this can't be your main system. if your a casual player definatley consider it or get a Wii and a 360 the perfect combo.  Original games and all your fave nintendo charecters more interactive then any games system.  PS3: I am not a sony hater i own a PSP but i am very disapointed with the  PS3 it is nothing new just better graffix sony needs a new controller and the blu-ray player in the ps3 wont play regular dvds it is way to expensive plain worst out of the 3 unless the games you like only come out for ps3  360: best of all it has a better GPU CPU and more RAM an for less that ps3 it the hardcore gamers dream machine and the best classic style controller out there (Wii remote is not a classic controler) the games aregreat it is the perfect combo with a Wii  conclusion: by a Wii and 360 and spend only 50 dollars more then it would cost buy a ps3 and both of them are better  it makes the ultimate gaming combo"", ""PS3 blows everything else away.  PS3 has Online gaming for free. Microsoft charges you another $70 for a year of online. and the wii, only charges for game downloads. PS3 has full HD support. neither the Wii or the 360 have anything close to that. PS3 has blu-ray compatibility. The Wii has nothing of the sort. and the 360 requires you spend $200 to play HD DVDs which arent even as good as blu-ray discs. Ps3 can store up to 60GB of music movies and games. 360 can store 20GB and Wii can store jack ****. Ps3 had games like resistance, Lair, Full auto 2, Motorstorm. the only good game of the 360 is halo 3, which wont be here until next november. PS3 has the option of HDMI, AV, Coaxial, or component output, the 360 gives you one cable that will use either A/V or Component, and they have the nerve to call the component output HD. wii makes you use AV. The Blu-ray discs used for PS3 games make the games enormous, and worth much more time. i beat gears of war on the 360 in 9 hours. i have been playing resistance for 12 hours and i am about one quarter the way through. the Wii isn't even worth mentioning here, all their games are aimed at children and can be finished with within 4 hours.  there is really no question as to which is better. the only reason you may hear negative things about the PS3 is because people have decided to jump on some PS3 hating bandwagon. they are the same ignorant dipshits that barge into best buy to buy an iPod without considering other players by creative.  'Gotta get an iPod, thats what everyone else has, everyone hates the PS3, i gotta hate it too' come on, grow up, get your own opinion."", ""Which is better?? It really depends on what you're looking for. If you're looking for a system with amazing graphics and overwhelming gameplay buy the new PlayStation 3, the PS3 can't do anything the PSP can't do except for graphics (It even has the same interface). If you're looking for a bundle of media capabilities, with a TV Tuner, DVR Recorder, Music/Video Player, Photos, With a Marketplace to buy Movies and TV Shows Buy the Xbox 360. The Nintendo Wii is also a great gaming system if you're into a old genre of games. It has great fun value, it's a great party tool and you can actually interact with your gameplay.  In my opinion, each one sticks out to do a certain purpose.""]",We can't recognize objects for comparision,We can't recognize objects for comparision,We can't recognize objects for comparision

It's also the only console of the three to really expand upon motion control and game interactivity. The PS3 has the highest price tag of the three.  This will put a lot of pressure on Sony to outperform the others.  After all, if you buy a $600 console and most of it's games are ports or average at best, you're going to be more than a little ticked.  It's definitely possible for them to go above and beyond with the PS3, but the matter of fact is that the price tag so far is a result only of the fancy hardware (like the blu-ray laser) that they have in the console, not a result of fun or enjoyable games.  We won't really know for sure until it's been released for a while, however. The Xbox 360 has been out for a time now.  It's nothing new.  So while it's hardware rivals that of the PS3, and it's price tag is much lower, I don't see a huge spike in Xbox 360 sales happening any time soon.  For me, the Xbox 360 (and the Xbox) games have been mediocre.  Perhaps best of all so far has been Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, which is also availiable on PC and will be a launch title for PS3. So my prediction is this: with the Wii, Nintendo will be climbing back in the ring as one of the top console developers once again, and this year it'll be a bare-knuckle brawl between the PS3 and the Wii.  With PS3's low ship numbers on launch, however, I expect we'll see more than a few people buy a Wii to tie them over until they can get their hands on a PS3, giving the Wii a numbers boost from both Nintendo fans and Playstation fans alike.  Just my opinion, though."", 'dude the ps3 is gonna be the bomb and ill prove it  go to a gamer website and look at the ratings for all 3 systems and ps3 has better ratings then other 2 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!', ""the nintendo wii WILL make more money on launch day. It's a FACT. PS3 costs more but the wii has way more units, almost twice as many. The PS3's price is a major issue. Although you do get what you pay for, a really nice dvd player with good graphics. But who cares! The wii has better graphics than the xbox and that's good enough. Plus the controller is the best part. If you bring a friend over to play a game, he would actually be able to play it and would have fun. A PS3, the friend would look at the graphics, and have a bad time playing it. Plus there are no good games for PS3. Nintendo has the best and always will. And for the xbox 360, sales are going to drop dramatically. Who wants a year old system when you can get a newer, more innovative one for less money. Retards, that's who.""]","The xbox 360 is b than playstation 3. The reason are easier, easier to work with and easier to use operating environment.  The same for the Vita.  In the same way that PS3 and Xbox 360 users enjoy the same gaming experience as their own, the new PlayStation 4 is much more complex.  The biggest difference in the PS4 is the fact that the console supports 2D, unlike PS3 and Xbox 360.  The PS4 also supports both touch pad and touch camera, but the PS4 supports both.  The same is true for the Vita.  The Vita also supports Kinect, which is a cool feature that we didn't see with the PS4.  It's great that you can control your own Kinect with a few taps of the keyboard, but that it's very limited with the 3DS.  We don't really understand the difference between the PS4 and PS3.  One thing that we are definitely aware of is that the Vita's 3DS support does not get any less of its appeal with the PS3.  The","The xbox 360 is b than playstation 3. The reason are easier, easier to work with and easier to use operating environment. Above: The real reason is that they didn't want the ""Xbox 2"" to sound inferior to the ""PlayStation 3,"" but you can't work Michael Jackson into that. My only complaint is that the PlayStation 3 console seems much slower than the Xbox 360 when downloading anything. Those frame-rate problems hit the PlayStation 3 version of the game significantly harder than the Xbox 360. The online experience on Xbox 360 is far superior to the Playstation 3's online experience. That's why I failed to give into Modern Warfare 3 or refuse PlayStation 3 versions that are inferior to the Xbox 360.
The Playstation 3 has better hardware than the XBox 360. Having a higher capacity optical drive doesn't make the Playstation 3 superior to the Xbox 360 in any meaningful way. ""In terms of value, the PlayStation 3 is a superior hardware product in comparison to the Xbox 360,"" he points out. The Playstation 3 graphics look a bit better than the Xbox 360 graphics. The reality is that the PlayStation 3 emulation is almost coming along faster than the Xbox 360 emulation progress.","I came to the conclusion that xbox 360 is better, because of easier, easier to work with and easier to use operating environment.

The reason are faster, cheaper and older. Even with that uptick, the Nintendo Wii U is selling worse on a monthly basis in the US than the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 have ever sold over the last seven years. For kids older than 12, gaming does a little worse; the Wii U only comes in at 17% while its older brethren the PlayStation 3 sitting at 8% and the Xbox 360 at 7%. Nintendo's been famously hesitant to acknowledge that this might be an area in which the HD-capable Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 consoles are superior, but the recent release of a Netflix disc for the Nintendo Wii put that console's failings in sharp relief. The Nintendo Wii U's processor is slower than its counterparts in the years-old Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, and the Wii U graphics chip either matches or is slightly faster than its rivals' graphics chips. But Game Informer said it could not confirm if the graphics would be better than that of the Xbox 360 or the Sony PlayStation 3.
I'm wondering though if Nintendo should have said that the Nintendo Wii U would be better then the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. We know that the new console will be a hardware step up from the Wii, and at least on par with or better than the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in terms of graphics. Fans will quickly point out that the hardware capabilities of Nintendo Wii U are equal or in some cases better then Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 consoles. What is on offer right here, right now, is actually a far better experience than the glitch-ridden Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions of FIFA 13 , and miles ahead of the Wii and 3DS editions as well.

In reality, you can't get a PS3 right now.  If you want to try, you stand in line in the cold getting shot at, or pay some white trash eBay scalper twice retail for one he's got sitting in motor oil in his garage next to his meth lab.

Even if you DO get one, it's a launch system, which means the odds of getting a buggy machine are WAY up there.  Remember all the buggy launch 360's?

These game systems are so heavily anticipated now that they get released before they're really fully functioning machines with all the bugs worked out, and certainly before they have a decent library of games to choose from.  The only thing worth playing on the PS3 right now is Resistance, and there are better games of its kind on the 360.

Speaking of which, the 360 is only marginally less powerful than the PS3.  It's been out a year, so it's actually generally available and has a decent range of games.  Plus it's $200 cheaper.  And seriously, looking at a PS3 game next to a 360 game, you really couldn't tell the difference at this point.  Maybe in a couple years you'll start to see the edge PS3 has technologically.

As for the Wii, it's nowhere near the power of the other 2, nor does it even try to compete.

If you want to get the most expensive system just to have it the PS3 will be the way to go.  If you're sick of gaming or want to try something new, the Wii is the way to go.

The 360 has a good lead currently, has the most options while in the game, and has achievements which does help it.  It is 200 dollars cheaper than the PS3, but can't play HD-DVDs with out a 200 dollar attachment.

The Ps3 is a strong system with a lot of power under it but currently no one has been able to tap into the full power of it.  Launch games for it looked far weaker then current gen Xbox 360 titles, and slighty worse than 360 launch titles (Ridge Racer 6 vs 7)  It also will be able to play blu-ray discs out of the box.   however many Ps3 exclusives have changed to be on the 360 and PS3.  

The wii, is the weakest console, but makes up for it with the very unique controller.  It has some significant launch titles (The Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess) and with the controller even games that are similar to the other systems like Call of Duty 3, will play very differently on the Wii.

If you are looking at it from an economical stand point the 360($400) is easily the top, as it's more powerful than the Wii ($250) but still affordable.  The Ps3 on the other hand is $600 dollars.  

You should have fun with any of the systems, the most important thing to keep in mind is to get the ""premium"" system if you choose the 360 or Ps3.

Yes the Sony3 might have better graphics over the Wii but the game cube has better graphics over the Xbox360 and the Ps2 and the Wii has better graphics then the Gamecube so when you look at it like that it still has great graphics. None of the 3 new systems will push there graphic or gameplay ability's to the max within the next 2 to 3 years. Game makers so far have not made a game that needs that much power yet.

On the other side, the Wii games look better than the Gamecube games, depending on the quality of the game itself. The N64 is the gretest revolution in Nintendo history, except for the Wii, because it intoduced true 3-D graphics, better games, and better everything else, the only thing greater than it is the Wii, the gamecube is still good though. I'd probably even argue that the Wii first-party games were better than those of the Gamecube. taxandspend : First of all I didn't say that the Wii was better than the Gamecube, I said it sold better.
Even Nintendo's worst selling console, the Gamecube, had a much better library of software than the Wii did. It's just another good example of why I still like the GameCube better than the Wii.

I actually thought the component output on the Gamecube was better than the Wii. Even Nintendo's worst selling console, the Gamecube, had a much better library of software than the Wii did. I think the Wii U is shaping up to be a worse console than the gamecube. It's just another good example of why I still like the GameCube better than the Wii.

So if you think you're getting the Wii sometime you might want to hold off on getting the new Zelda....


BTW, the control sensor for Wii doesn't make Link swing his sword the way you move your hand, it follows a random order of sword movements.

N64 was far superior to the PS1, Xbox and Gamecube were far greater than PS2 (Hell, even the Dreamcast was better than the PS2.) When Nintendo released the gamecube it was 2x faster than the PS2, yet the PS2 out sold it by almost double.
Sony's PS2 similarly only sold a quarter of its eventual installed base at a price greater than $200 (Nintendo's Gamecube never sold for greater than $200). you know ps2 is rubbish (4:26am EST Sat Jan 18 2003) you know ps2 is rubbish so why argue saying its better than xbox and gamecube. The PS2 is just a better machine than the GameCube. btw i think the ps2 uses the same stick technology as the dreamcast so that would be easier than swapping it with gamecube stick.

I expect, however, that Eclipse will continue to grow faster than NetBeans."" Concerning the visual part, Eclipse + VE is better than Netbeans.

It's okay, But the Wii Version looks like it has better graphics, More advance Gameplay, More animals than in the DS one, and It looks much better. ^ Personally, I think the Wii games are better than the DS game. The Wii game is of course far better than the previous games, as is the DS game. 3DS and Wii U (in particular) will perform better than expected, beating the DS/Wii sales in the same time frame.

Toyota has had a few more recalls over the last year than previous years, but that's not at all to imply anything meaningfully negative.

They are available with some fantastic engines.  The interiors are light years ahead of my last-gen Chevy truck. Quality remains to be seen - it's a brand new vehicle. Fuel economy may be a slight edge for Toyota, because it always has been.
